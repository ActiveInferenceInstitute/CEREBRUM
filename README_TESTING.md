# Test-Driven Development in CEREBRUM

This document outlines the test-driven development (TDD) approach used in the CEREBRUM project.

## Overview

CEREBRUM follows test-driven development practices to ensure code quality, maintainability, and correctness. TDD is a development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle:

1. Write a test for the functionality you want to add
2. Run the test and see it fail (since the functionality doesn't exist yet)
3. Write the minimum code to make the test pass
4. Refactor the code to improve quality while keeping the tests passing
5. Repeat

## Testing Structure

CEREBRUM's testing approach is organized into several layers:

### Unit Tests

Unit tests verify individual components in isolation. These tests are fast, focused, and should cover all edge cases for each component. In CEREBRUM, unit tests are organized by component:

- `test_model.py`: Tests for the base Model class
- `test_case_transformations.py`: Tests for case transformation functions
- `test_animal_transformations.py`: Tests for animal-specific transformations
- `test_environment.py`: Tests for environment components

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that different components work together correctly. These tests focus on the interactions between components and are located in the `tests/integration/` directory:

- `test_model_interactions.py`: Tests for interactions between models

### Property-Based Tests

Property-based tests use the `hypothesis` framework to test properties that should hold for any valid input, rather than specific examples. This helps find edge cases and unexpected behaviors:

- `test_model_properties.py`: Tests properties of models using randomized inputs

## Running Tests

### Basic Usage

Run all tests:

```bash
python src/scripts/run_tests.py
```

Run unit tests only:

```bash
python src/scripts/run_tests.py --unit-only
```

Run with coverage report:

```bash
python src/scripts/run_tests.py --coverage --html
```

### Advanced Usage

Run tests for a specific module:

```bash
python src/scripts/run_tests.py --module model
```

Run a specific test file:

```bash
pytest src/tests/test_model.py
```

## Test Development Guidelines

### When to Write Tests

- **Before implementation**: Write tests before implementing new features or fixing bugs.
- **For regression**: Add tests when fixing bugs to prevent them from recurring.
- **For refactoring**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage before refactoring.

### Test Quality Checklist

- Tests should be isolated and not depend on other tests.
- Each test should test one thing clearly.
- Tests should have descriptive names explaining what they test.
- Use parameterized tests for similar test cases with different inputs.
- Tests should run quickly and not depend on external resources.

### Best Practices

1. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Structure tests with setup, execution, and verification phases.
2. **Use fixtures**: Use pytest fixtures for common setup and teardown.
3. **Small, focused tests**: Each test should verify one behavior.
4. **Descriptive test names**: Name tests descriptively, following `test_what_happens_when_condition` pattern.
5. **Test error cases**: Test both success and failure scenarios.
6. **Test edge cases**: Include tests for edge cases and boundary conditions.

## Testing Tools

CEREBRUM uses the following testing tools:

- **pytest**: Core testing framework
- **pytest-cov**: Code coverage reporting
- **hypothesis**: Property-based testing
- **pytest-mock**: Mocking utilities

## Continuous Integration

Tests are automatically run in continuous integration to verify that all tests pass before changes are merged.

## Test Coverage

CEREBRUM aims for high test coverage, especially for core components. Coverage reports can be generated with:

```bash
python src/scripts/run_tests.py --coverage --html
```

The HTML report will be available in the `coverage_html_report` directory.
