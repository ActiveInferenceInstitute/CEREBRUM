# Linear Regression Case Tests

This directory contains test results for linear regression models in the context of linguistic cases.

## Directory Structure

- **nominative/** - Subject performing the action in regression context
  - Statistical role: Model as parameter estimator
  - Regression context: Model actively fitting parameters to data

- **accusative/** - Direct object receiving action in regression context
  - Statistical role: Model as evaluation subject
  - Regression context: Model undergoing evaluation or testing

- **dative/** - Indirect object or recipient in regression context
  - Statistical role: Model as data recipient
  - Regression context: Model receiving or being given data

- **genitive/** - Possessive or relational function in regression context
  - Statistical role: Model as prediction generator
  - Regression context: Model generating predictions from inputs

- **instrumental/** - Means or instrument of action in regression context
  - Statistical role: Model as analytical instrument
  - Regression context: Using model as a tool for data analysis

- **locative/** - Location or position indication in regression context
  - Statistical role: Model position in parameter space
  - Regression context: Model at a position in parameter/hypothesis space

- **ablative/** - Movement away from or source in regression context
  - Statistical role: Model as information source
  - Regression context: Extracting insights or derivations from model

- **vocative/** - Direct address or calling in regression context
  - Statistical role: Direct model interaction
  - Regression context: Querying or commanding the model directly


## Generated Visualizations

Each case directory contains visualizations specific to that case's interpretation in linear regression:

- **linguistic_context.png** - Visual representation of the case's linguistic meaning
- Animation files (GIF format) showing the dynamic behavior of the model
- Static visualizations of model parameters, predictions, and error metrics
