VOCATIVE CASE RESULTS
====================

Linguistic meaning: Direct address or calling
Statistical role: Direct model interaction
Regression context: Querying or commanding the model directly

Model Parameters:
- Intercept: 4.977458
- Slope: 1.966485
- Model Formula: y = 4.977458 + 1.966485x

Communication Analysis (VOCATIVE Case):
- Data-to-Model Communication: Residuals represent 'messages' from data to model
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 43.282361
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 6.578933
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 5.256358
- R-squared: 0.000000

Linguistic Formula Example:
MODEL, what is the predicted value for this input?

VOCATIVE Case Interpretation:
In the VOCATIVE case, we explore how model components 'address' each other
and how data and model communicate. Key insights include:

1. Data-to-Model Communication:
   - Each data point 'addresses' the model with its true value
   - The model responds with its prediction
   - The residual represents the 'conversation' between data and model

2. Model Component Communication:
   - Input features address the coefficients (slope)
   - Coefficients address the prediction function
   - Intercept addresses the prediction independently
