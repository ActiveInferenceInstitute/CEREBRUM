ABLATIVE CASE RESULTS
====================

Linguistic meaning: Movement away from or source
Statistical role: Model as information source
Regression context: Extracting insights or derivations from model

Model Parameters:
- Intercept: -2.014790
- Slope: 2.954023
- Model Formula: y = -2.014790 + 2.954023x

Evaluation Metrics:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.806585
- R-squared: 0.989560

Transformation Analysis:
- Noise transformations: Demonstrating how noise emerges FROM the model
- Scaling transformations: Showing amplification/attenuation FROM the model
- Bias transformations: Illustrating systematic shifts FROM the model

Causal Analysis:
- Model as origin/cause of predictions
- Predictions leading to decisions
- Decisions resulting in outcomes
- Complete causal chain originating FROM the model

Linguistic Analysis (ABLATIVE Case):
- The model is the SOURCE from which predictions originate
- Predictions come FROM the model (not TO the model)
- Transformations are derived FROM model computation
- Outcomes ultimately stem FROM the model's initial processing

Linguistic Formula Example:
From the MODEL, we can derive feature importance.
