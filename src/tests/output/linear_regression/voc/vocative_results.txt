VOCATIVE CASE RESULTS
=====================

Linguistic meaning: Direct address or invocation
Statistical role: Model as interactive interface
Regression context: The user interface to the regression model, APIs, or interactive diagnostics

Interface Queries:
- predict: Model predicts value at X=2.5: 5.690654

Model Parameters (via interface):
- Intercept: -1.896800
- Coefficient 1: 3.034981

Evaluation Metrics (via interface):
- r2: 0.950164
- mse: 4.219834
- mae: 1.643877

Linguistic Formula Example:
HEY LINEAR MODEL, what is the prediction for this input?

VOCATIVE Case Description:
The VOCATIVE case represents the model as an addressable entity that responds to
specific queries through well-defined interfaces. In natural language, this parallels
direct address or calling something by name ('Hey Siri...'). For regression models,
this case emphasizes the interactive API aspects of the model, with clear query-response
patterns and interface conventions. The model is treated as an entity that can be
directly addressed, queried, and will respond with appropriate information.
