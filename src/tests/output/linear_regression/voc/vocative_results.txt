VOCATIVE CASE RESULTS
====================

Linguistic meaning: Direct address or calling
Statistical role: Direct model interaction
Regression context: Querying or commanding the model directly

Query-Response Interactions:
- Query 1: What is the predicted value at x=1.5?
  Response: Prediction = 2.4162

- Query 2: What is the confidence interval at x=2.0?
  Response: Prediction = 3.8933, 95% CI = [3.6948, 4.0917]

- Query 3: What is the prediction error at x=0?
  Response: Prediction = -2.0148

- Query 4: What is your formula?
  Response: Formula = y = -2.0148 + 2.9540 * x_1

- Query 5: What is your valid input range?
  Response: Valid range = [-10.0, 10.0]
Recommended = (-5.0, 5.0)

- Query 6: Explain your prediction at x=3.0
  Response: Prediction = 6.8473
  Components:
    - intercept: -2.0148
    - x_1: 8.8621

Linguistic Formula Example:
MODEL, what is the predicted value for this input?
