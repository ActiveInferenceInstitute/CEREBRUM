NOMINATIVE CASE RESULTS
======================

Linguistic meaning: Subject performing the action
Statistical role: Model as parameter estimator
Regression context: Model actively fitting parameters to data

Model Parameters (from active fitting):
- Intercept: 4.977458
- Slope: 1.966485
- Model Formula: y = 4.977458 + 1.966485x

Performance Metrics:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 1.851910
- R-squared: 0.944684

Gradient Descent Analysis:
- Initial cost: 52.432498
- Final cost: 14.936449
- Reduction: 71.51%
- Iterations: 30

Linguistic Analysis (NOMINATIVE Case):
- The model acts as the SUBJECT performing the action
- Active verbs: Computes, Measures, Adjusts, Reduces, Fits, Learns
- Objects: Parameters, Errors, Predictions, Data

Linguistic Formula Example:
The MODEL fits the parameters to the data.
