Data Processing Summary:
- Original data: 50 training points
- Processed in 5 batches of ~10 points each
- Mean of original y: 3.9141
- Mean of processed y: 0.0000
- Standard deviation change: 5.7861 → 4.6545

- R²: Not available (empty test set)
- MSE: Not available (empty test set)
- MAE: Not available (empty test set)

Linguistic Formula Example:
We give the data to the MODEL.
