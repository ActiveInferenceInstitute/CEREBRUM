INSTRUMENTAL CASE RESULTS
=======================

Linguistic meaning: Means or instrument of action
Statistical role: Model as statistical methodology
Regression context: The specific algorithm (OLS, gradient descent) used to solve the regression problem

Normal Equation Implementation:
- Formula: θ = (X^T * X)^-1 * X^T * y

Computation Steps (with small example):
- X^T * X:
[[ 7.  0.]
 [ 0. 28.]]

- (X^T * X)^-1:
[[0.14285714 0.        ]
 [0.         0.03571429]]

- X^T * y:
[[ 6.91694399]
 [58.88305802]]

- Result (θ): [0.9881, 2.1030]

Actual Model Parameters:
- Intercept: -1.896800
- Coefficient 1: 3.034981

Linguistic Formula Example:
The researcher solves the problem WITH the LINEAR MODEL.
