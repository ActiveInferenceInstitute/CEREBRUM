ACCUSATIVE CASE RESULTS
======================

Linguistic meaning: Direct object receiving action
Statistical role: Model as evaluation subject
Regression context: Model undergoing evaluation or testing

Model Parameters:
- Intercept: 0.992709
- Slope: 2.471150
- Model Formula: y = 0.992709 + 2.471150x

- Average MSE: 0.209109 ± 0.044597
- Average R²: 0.995595 ± 0.002197

Residual Analysis:
- Mean of residuals: 0.000000
- Standard deviation: 0.449050
- Range: [-0.963709, 1.146526]

Linguistic Analysis (ACCUSATIVE Case):
- The model is the OBJECT receiving the action of evaluation
- Verbs acting on the model: Test, Evaluate, Validate, Assess
- Subjects performing the action: Researchers, Analysts, Tests

Linguistic Formula Example:
We evaluate the MODEL on test data.
