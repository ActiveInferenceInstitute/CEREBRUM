- Standard deviation: 1.360849
- Range: [-3.751019, 2.519952]

Linguistic Analysis (ACCUSATIVE Case):
- The model is the OBJECT receiving the action of evaluation
- Verbs acting on the model: Test, Evaluate, Validate, Assess
- Subjects performing the action: Researchers, Analysts, Tests

Linguistic Formula Example:
We evaluate the MODEL on test data.
