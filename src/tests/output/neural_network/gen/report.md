# Neural Network in GEN Case

## Possessive/Source

Statistical role: Output source

### Context

The neural network as a source of outputs and predictions

### Mathematical Representation

```
ŷ = f(x; θ)
```

### Primary Methods

generate_output(), get_predictions()

### Example

The NEURAL NETWORK's OUTPUTS are used for decision-making

### Analysis Results

* Model architecture: Input(1) → Hidden(10) → Hidden(5) → Output(1)
* Activation function: relu
* Test MSE: 0.008090

### Output Generation Analysis

In the GENITIVE case, the focus is on the neural network as the source of outputs. The visualizations show the distribution of generated outputs and the activations in the final layer, highlighting the model's role as a generator.

### GENITIVE Case Significance

This case views the model possessively, emphasizing 'the model's output'. It focuses on the final results generated by the network and the internal states directly leading to those outputs.
