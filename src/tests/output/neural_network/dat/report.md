# Neural Network in DAT Case

## Indirect object/Recipient

Statistical role: Data receiver

### Context

The neural network as a recipient of input data

### Mathematical Representation

```
input → network
```

### Primary Methods

receive_data(), process_inputs()

### Example

The dataset GIVES inputs TO the NEURAL NETWORK

### Analysis Results

* Model architecture: Input(1) → Hidden(8) → Hidden(4) → Output(1)
* Activation function: sigmoid
* Input feature sensitivities:
  - Feature 1: 0.034972

### Input Processing Analysis

In the DATIVE case, we focus on how the neural network receives and processes input data. The visualizations show the input distributions, feature correlations, and the resulting activations in the first layer of the network.

### DATIVE Case Significance

In the DATIVE case, the neural network is treated as the recipient of inputs. This perspective emphasizes how the model receives and processes input data, focusing on the input layer and early transformations rather than the final output.
