# POMDP Model in DAT Case

## Indirect object/Recipient

Statistical role: Receiver of information

### Context

The POMDP as a recipient of observations from the environment

### Mathematical Representation

```
p(o|s)
```

### Primary Methods

observe(), receive_observation()

### Example

The environment GIVES observations TO the POMDP

### Analysis Results

* Number of observation sequences: 4
* Steps per sequence: 15
* Model parameters:
  - States: 2
  - Observations: 2
  - Actions: ['left', 'right']

### Observation Reception Analysis

In the DATIVE case, the POMDP is treated as a recipient of observations. The focus is on how the model receives and processes these observations to update its beliefs. The visualizations show the observation sequences and their impact on the model's belief state.

Key insights:
1. Observations with higher likelihood (p(o|s)) have a stronger influence on belief updates
2. The KL divergence between consecutive belief states measures the information gain from each observation
3. The model's belief state converges toward the true state as it receives more informative observations
