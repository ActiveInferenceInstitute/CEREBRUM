# POMDP Model in ACC Case

## Direct object/Receiver of action

Statistical role: Object of evaluation

### Context

The POMDP as an object being evaluated or updated by external processes

### Mathematical Representation

```
J(π) = E[∑γᵗR(sₜ,aₜ)]
```

### Primary Methods

evaluate(), update_parameters()

### Example

The programmer EVALUATES the POMDP's performance

### Evaluation Results

* Number of evaluation scenarios: 5
* Steps per scenario: 15
* Model parameters:
  - States: 2
  - Observations: 2
  - Actions: ['left', 'right']
* Evaluation metrics (mean ± std):
  - Belief accuracy: 0.6726 ± 0.0873
  - Decision accuracy: 0.7733 ± 0.1236
  - Belief entropy: 0.7018 ± 0.0297 bits

### Evaluation Process Analysis

In the ACCUSATIVE case, the POMDP is treated as an object of evaluation. External processes evaluate the model's performance on various scenarios, measuring its ability to accurately track the true state and make effective decisions. The model doesn't actively choose actions in this case, but is instead controlled by the evaluation process.
