### POMDP as Computational Method

In the INSTRUMENTAL case, the POMDP acts as a computational method or tool. The focus is on algorithmic properties such as convergence, efficiency, and comparison to other methods. The visualizations highlight these aspects across different problem scenarios.

Key insights:
1. The POMDP algorithm converges to accurate state predictions over time
2. Computational requirements vary with problem difficulty and uncertainty
3. The optimal POMDP method outperforms simpler heuristics, especially in difficult scenarios
4. Initial beliefs and observation noise impact convergence rates and computational efficiency
