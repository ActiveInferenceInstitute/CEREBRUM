# Somatic Therapy Session

**Date**: June 15, 2025  
**Session**: #8  
**Therapist**: Dr. Maya Wilson  
**Client**: Alex Thompson

**Dr. Wilson**: Welcome, Alex. How are you feeling today?

**Alex**: Tense. I can feel tightness in my shoulders.

**Dr. Wilson**: When you notice the tension, where do you sense it most?

**Alex**: Mostly in my shoulders and neck. Sometimes it feels like a weight pressing on me.  
I wish I could let go of this heaviness, but it seems to come from my work stress.  
My friend’s advice helps a bit, and I try to give myself some compassion.  
Dr. Wilson, can you guide me through a grounding exercise?

**Dr. Wilson**: Of course. Let’s begin by noticing the support of the chair beneath you.
