**Sarah**: Welcome back to The Sky's the Limit. I'm Sarah Chen, and today we're diving into the remarkable journey of AeroSwift Dynamics, the Austin-based drone company that just closed their Series B funding round with Andreessen Horowitz. Joining me are co-founders Marcus Rodriguez and Dr. Elena Petrov. Marcus, let's start with the origin story.

**Marcus**: Thanks for having us, Sarah. It all started back in 2019 when Elena and I were both at Boeing's Phantom Works division in Seattle. We were working on the MQ-25 Stingray project, developing autonomous aerial refueling capabilities for the Navy.

**Dr. Petrov**: The frustration was real. We kept seeing these massive inefficiencies in traditional aerospace development cycles. Six-month hardware iterations, regulatory approval processes that took years, and costs that made innovation prohibitively expensive for smaller applications.

**Sarah**: What was the specific moment you realized there was a commercial opportunity?

**Marcus**: Hurricane Harvey in 2017. Elena and I were volunteering with FEMA's disaster response team, and we watched first responders struggle with outdated communication infrastructure. Cell towers were down, roads were flooded, but they needed real-time situational awareness.

**Dr. Petrov**: We jerry-rigged a mesh network using modified DJI Phantom drones with custom payload modules I'd been developing. Within hours, we had emergency coordinators accessing live video feeds and communication relays across a 50-square-mile disaster zone.

**Sarah**: That's when you knew you had something?

**Marcus**: Exactly. We saw search and rescue teams from Harris County Sheriff's Department reduce their response times by 73%. The Red Cross emergency coordinator, Janet Morrison, pulled us aside and said, "Whatever you just did, we need this in every disaster response toolkit."

**Dr. Petrov**: The technical challenge was fascinating though. We needed edge computing capabilities, 5G integration, LiDAR sensors, and thermal imagingâ€”all while maintaining flight endurance beyond what traditional quadcopter architectures could handle.
