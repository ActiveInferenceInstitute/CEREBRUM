# Methods: Synthesis, Characterization, and Antimicrobial Efficacy of Silver Nanoparticles

## Materials and Reagents

All chemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification. Silver nitrate (AgNO₃, 99.8%), sodium borohydride (NaBH₄, 98%), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, Mw = 40,000), trisodium citrate dihydrate (C₆H₅Na₃O₇·2H₂O, 99%), and ethanol (99.5%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Deionized water (18.2 MΩ·cm) was obtained from a Millipore purification system. Mueller-Hinton agar and broth were purchased from Difco Laboratories. Bacterial strains including Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.

## Synthesis of Silver Nanoparticles

### Chemical Reduction Method
Silver nanoparticles were synthesized using a modified chemical reduction approach. A 50 mL aqueous solution containing 1 mM AgNO₃ and 0.5% (w/v) PVP was prepared under continuous magnetic stirring at 300 rpm. The solution was maintained at 60°C in a temperature-controlled water bath. A freshly prepared 10 mM NaBH₄ solution (5 mL) was rapidly injected into the reaction mixture, resulting in an immediate color change from colorless to yellow-brown, indicating nanoparticle formation. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 minutes under vigorous stirring, followed by cooling to room temperature.

### Citrate Reduction Method
An alternative synthesis route employed trisodium citrate as both reducing and stabilizing agent. A 100 mL solution of 1 mM AgNO₃ was brought to boiling temperature under reflux conditions. Upon reaching boiling, 10 mL of 1% (w/v) trisodium citrate solution was added dropwise over 10 minutes. The reaction mixture was maintained at boiling temperature for an additional 30 minutes, during which the solution gradually changed from colorless to pale yellow, then to deep yellow, and finally to gray-green, indicating the formation of silver nanoparticles of varying sizes.

## Characterization Techniques

### UV-Visible Spectroscopy
Optical properties of the synthesized nanoparticles were analyzed using a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 300-800 nm. Samples were diluted 1:10 with deionized water and placed in quartz cuvettes with 1 cm path length. The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak position and full width at half maximum (FWHM) were recorded to estimate particle size distribution and stability.

### Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)
Particle size distribution and zeta potential measurements were performed using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS instrument. Samples were diluted to appropriate concentrations (typically 0.1 mg/mL) and analyzed at 25°C. Each measurement consisted of 15 runs with automatic optimization of measurement position and laser attenuation. The hydrodynamic diameter and polydispersity index (PDI) were calculated using the CONTIN algorithm.

### Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
Morphological analysis was conducted using a JEOL JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV. Samples were prepared by depositing 10 μL of nanoparticle suspension onto carbon-coated copper grids (300 mesh) and allowing them to air-dry for 24 hours. Particle size analysis was performed using ImageJ software on at least 200 particles from multiple micrographs.

### X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
Crystalline structure analysis was performed using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Samples were prepared by drop-casting concentrated nanoparticle suspensions onto glass slides and allowing them to dry at room temperature. Diffraction patterns were recorded in the 2θ range of 20-80° with a step size of 0.02° and scan rate of 1°/min.

### Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)
Surface functionalization and chemical composition were analyzed using a PerkinElmer Spectrum Two FTIR spectrometer in attenuated total reflectance (ATR) mode. Samples were prepared by mixing nanoparticles with KBr powder and pressing into pellets. Spectra were recorded in the range of 4000-400 cm⁻¹ with 32 scans and 4 cm⁻¹ resolution.

## Antimicrobial Testing

### Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) Determination
The antimicrobial efficacy was evaluated using the broth microdilution method according to CLSI guidelines (M07-A10). Bacterial cultures were grown overnight in Mueller-Hinton broth at 37°C and adjusted to 1 × 10⁶ CFU/mL using 0.5 McFarland standard. Two-fold serial dilutions of silver nanoparticles (0.5-256 μg/mL) were prepared in 96-well microtiter plates. After 18-24 hours incubation at 37°C, MIC values were determined as the lowest concentration that completely inhibited visible bacterial growth.

### Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) Assay
MBC values were determined by subculturing 10 μL from wells showing no visible growth onto Mueller-Hinton agar plates. After 24 hours incubation at 37°C, MBC was defined as the lowest concentration that resulted in ≥99.9% reduction in bacterial viability compared to the initial inoculum.

### Time-Kill Kinetics
Time-kill studies were performed by inoculating 10⁶ CFU/mL of test organisms into Mueller-Hinton broth containing 2× MIC of silver nanoparticles. Aliquots were withdrawn at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours, serially diluted, and plated on Mueller-Hinton agar. Colony counts were performed after 24 hours incubation at 37°C.

### Biofilm Inhibition Assay
Biofilm formation inhibition was assessed using the crystal violet staining method. Bacterial cultures (1 × 10⁶ CFU/mL) were incubated in 96-well polystyrene plates with varying concentrations of silver nanoparticles (0-64 μg/mL) for 24 hours at 37°C. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), biofilms were stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 15 minutes, destained with 95% ethanol, and absorbance measured at 595 nm.
