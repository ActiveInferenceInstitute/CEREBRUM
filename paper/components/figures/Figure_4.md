Figure 4. Generative Model Integration in Intelligence Case Management. This diagram illustrates how CEREBRUM's generative model core orchestrates both intelligence production and case management functions through case-specific transformations. At the center lies the core generative model that serves as the intelligence case manager, handling predictive processing, case transformations, and resource allocation. The intelligence production cycle (top) consists of four main components: Data Collection (utilizing models in Dative [DAT] and Locative [LOC] cases for input processing and context mapping); Analysis (employing models in Nominative [NOM] and Instrumental [INS] cases for active inference and method application); Synthesis (using models in Accusative [ACC] and Genitive [GEN] cases for model updates and product generation); and Dissemination (leveraging models in Genitive [GEN], Ablative [ABL], and Vocative [VOC] cases for report creation, source attribution, and direct interface). The case management functions (bottom) include Case Tracking for status monitoring, Workflow Control for process orchestration, and Quality Assurance for validation checks and error minimization. This architecture demonstrates how the assignment of specific cases to models enables dynamic role transitions as intelligence products move through the workflow, creating a flexible yet structured approach to intelligence production and management.
