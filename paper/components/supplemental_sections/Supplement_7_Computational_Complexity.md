# Supplement 7: Computational Complexity of Case Transformations

## 7.1 Introduction: Resource Scaling in Case-Based Cognitive Systems

The computational requirements of generative models in CEREBRUM vary significantly based on their case declensions. Each case imposes distinct resource constraints, optimization patterns, and scaling relationships with problem complexity. This supplement provides a comprehensive analysis of the computational complexity characteristics across different case assignments, with particular focus on Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) formulations under the Free Energy Principle. We examine both theoretical bounds and practical implementations to demonstrate how intelligent resource allocation strategies can optimize overall system performance through appropriate case assignments.

## 7.2 Active Inference Framework for Case-Based Computational Analysis

To formalize our analysis, we adapt the traditional POMDP framework to an Active Inference perspective, defined by the tuple $(S, A, T, \Omega, O, F)$ where:
- $S$ is a finite set of states $s$
- $A$ is a finite set of actions $a$
- $T: S \times A \times S \rightarrow [0,1]$ is the transition function, where $T(s'|s,a)$ represents the probability of transitioning to state $s'$ from state $s$ given action $a$
- $\Omega$ is a finite set of observations $o$
- $O: S \times A \times \Omega \rightarrow [0,1]$ is the observation function
- $F$ is the variational free energy, defined as $F = D_{KL}[q(s|T(m))||p(s|m)] - \mathbb{E}_{p}[\log p(o|s,T(m))]$

Unlike traditional POMDP formulations that incorporate reward functions, our Active Inference framework operates directly on probability distributions, using surprise minimization bounded by:
1. Variational Free Energy $(F)$ for perception and state estimation
2. Expected Free Energy $(\mathbb{E}[\Delta F])$ for action selection and planning

Within this framework, we analyze how different case assignments affect computational resource requirements based on:
1. State space complexity
2. Belief update operations via free energy minimization
3. Policy computation complexity via expected free energy minimization
4. Precision-weighted attention allocation $\beta(c,m)$
5. Memory requirements for historical data
6. Communication overhead between models

## 7.5 Precision-Weighted Resource Allocation in Active Inference

Within the active inference formulation, CEREBRUM optimizes computational resource allocation through precision-weighting mechanisms $\beta(c,m)$ that dynamically adjust resource distribution based on expected information gain. This approach leads to several important observations regarding case-based resource scaling:

1. **Precision-Driven Priority Shifting**: Resources are allocated preferentially to high-precision components of the generative model, with precision distributions varying by case assignment:
   - [NOM] cases receive maximum precision for likelihood mapping $p(o|s,\theta)$
   - [ACC] cases prioritize precision for parameter updates $\frac{\partial F}{\partial \theta}$
   - [DAT] cases emphasize precision for input processing of observations $o$
   - [GEN] cases maximize precision for output generation

2. **Free Energy Budgeting**: Overall system resources are allocated to minimize expected free energy $\mathbb{E}[\Delta F]$ across case-bearing components, leading to resource conservation where precision is lower.

3. **Hierarchical Memory Access**: Cases implement different memory access patterns with hierarchical precision weighting $\beta(c,m)$ determining depth and breadth of working memory allocation.

## 7.6 Resource Optimization Strategies for Case Transitions

CEREBRUM implementations can leverage several strategies to optimize resource utilization during case transformations $T(m)$:

1. **Just-in-Time Compilation**: Selectively compile and execute only the necessary components for the current case assignment
2. **Case-Specific Memory Management**: Implement memory allocation strategies tailored to each case's access patterns
3. **Predictive Preloading**: Anticipate case transitions $T(s'|s,a)$ and preload resources based on transition probabilities
4. **Graduated Fidelity Control**: Adjust computational precision $\beta(c,m)$ based on case-specific sensitivity requirements
5. **Parallel Case Processing**: Distribute compatible case operations across parallel computing resources

## 7.7 Theoretical Bounds on Case-Based Resource Optimization

We establish several theoretical bounds on the performance gains achievable through case-based resource optimization:

**Theorem 1: Nominal-Vocative Efficiency Ratio**
For any generative model $m$ with state space $S$, the ratio of computational resources required in nominative vs. vocative case is lower-bounded by $\Omega(|S|)$.

**Theorem 2: Ablative Storage Efficiency**
For any model with historical depth $|H|$, temporal compression strategies can reduce storage requirements from $O(|H| \times |S|)$ to $O(|H| \times \log|S|)$ while preserving causal inference capabilities.

**Theorem 3: Dative-Accusative Complementarity**
Models alternating between dative and accusative cases can achieve Pareto-optimal resource utilization when input processing (DAT) and parameter updates (ACC) are time-multiplexed.

## 7.8 Case Selection as Resource Optimization Strategy

Strategic case assignment emerges as a powerful resource optimization approach in complex modeling ecosystems. When multiple models have overlapping capabilities, assigning complementary cases allows the system to optimize resource utilization while maintaining functional coverage.

### 7.8.1 Resource-Optimal Case Assignment Algorithm

```
Algorithm 1: Resource-Optimal Case Assignment

Input: Set of models M, set of functions F, resource constraints R
Output: Case assignments C for each model in M

1. Initialize priority queue Q based on function importance
2. For each function f in F (in priority order):
   a. Identify minimal resource requirements r_f for function f
   b. Select model m from M with best performance/resource ratio for f
   c. Assign case to m that optimizes for function f
   d. Update available resources: R = R - r_f
   e. Update model capabilities based on new case assignment
3. Optimize remaining case assignments for models without critical functions
4. Return case assignments C
```

This algorithm demonstrates how CEREBRUM systems can dynamically adjust case assignments to achieve resource-optimal configurations under varying constraints.

## 7.9 Practical Implications for Implementation

   - [ABL] cases can leverage tiered storage with cold/warm/hot zones
   - [VOC] cases operate effectively from cache memory during activation

3. **Distributed Computing Patterns**:
   - [DAT] cases perform well in edge computing configurations
   - [NOM] cases benefit from centralized computing resources
   - [GEN] cases can be effectively distributed across specialized processing units

4. **Scaling Constraints**:
   - [ABL] case scaling is storage-bound in most implementations

   - [VOC] case scaling is primarily latency-bound during activation

## 7.10 Conclusion: Computational Complexity as Design Principle

The computational complexity characteristics of different case assignments provide a principled foundation for resource-aware cognitive system design. By understanding the distinct scaling properties of each case, CEREBRUM implementations can:

1. Strategically assign cases to optimize system-wide resource utilization
2. Predict performance bottlenecks before they manifest
3. Design hardware acceleration strategies aligned with case-specific demands
4. Implement precision-weighted resource allocation mechanisms $\beta(c,m)$
5. Develop case transition protocols that minimize resource contention

This analysis demonstrates that case declension not only provides a linguistic-inspired framework for understanding model relationships but also constitutes a practical resource optimization strategy for complex cognitive systems.
