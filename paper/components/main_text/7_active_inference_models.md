## Active Inference Integration
CEREBRUM integrates with active inference principles by framing case transformations as predictive processes operating within a free energy minimization framework. Case transitions are formalized as parameterized Bayesian inference operations that minimize variational free energy across model interfaces. This conceptual alignment is illustrated in Figure 13, which depicts case transitions driven by hierarchical prediction error minimization through precision-weighted message passing. The specific message passing rules governing these transformations under active inference are detailed in Figure 14 and formally defined in Supplement 11.

## Formal Case Calculus
The interactions and transformations between case-bearing models in CEREBRUM adhere to a formal calculus derived from grammatical case systems. This calculus defines the permissible transitions and combinatorial rules for models based on their assigned cases, as formally presented in Figure 15 and mathematically elaborated in Supplement 9. Case transformations follow category-theoretic principles where morphisms preserve semantic integrity while modifying interface properties and precision parameters.

## Cross-Domain Integration Benefits
CEREBRUM's strength lies in its synthesis of concepts from four foundational domains: Linguistic Case Systems, Cognitive Systems Modeling, Active Inference, and Intelligence Production. The benefits derived from this integration are summarized in Table 4.

## Related Work
CEREBRUM synthesizes concepts from several established research traditions. While this initial paper focuses on presenting the core framework, future work will elaborate on specific theoretical derivations and connections. CEREBRUM builds upon related approaches in the following areas:

### Cognitive Architectures
CEREBRUM introduces a novel perspective on intelligent system design by using linguistic declension as inspiration for flexible model architectures with dynamic role assignment [1]. Unlike traditional cognitive architectures such as ACT-R and Soar where components have fixed functions [2], CEREBRUM enables cognitive models to adapt their roles via case transformations. This facilitates both flexibility and specialization, applying morphological transformations to generative models to create polymorphic components that maintain core identity while adapting interfaces, parameters, and dynamics to context [3]. This provides a principled foundation for coordinating complex model ecosystems, as detailed in Supplement 3.

### Category-Theoretic Cognition
The formalization of CEREBRUM using category theory provides a basis for compositional reasoning about cognitive systems [4]. By representing case transformations as functors between categories of models, the framework enables formal verification of properties like identity preservation across functional transitions [5]. This supports reasoning about model composition, transformation sequencing, and structural relationships, aligning with the compositional nature of cognition [6]. These category-theoretic foundations are mathematically formalized in Supplement 9.

### Active Inference Applications
CEREBRUM extends active inference from individual processes to entire model ecosystems [7]. By treating case transformations as precision-weighted processes minimizing free energy across the system [8], the framework implements principled coordination by explicitly representing functional relationships through case assignments and formalizing interfaces with precision-weighting [9]. This creates intelligent workflows where models cooperate to minimize system-wide free energy, with the formal mathematical definitions provided in Supplement 11.

### Linguistic Computing
CEREBRUM exemplifies a linguistic computing approach, applying declensional semantics to model management [10]. By treating models as entities assuming different morphological forms based on functional roles—mirroring noun declension in natural languages [11]—the framework implements computable declension paradigms allowing for more expressive and flexible representations of model relationships than traditional paradigms [12]. This bridges natural and artificial intelligence systems through shared linguistic principles, as explored in Supplement 2.

See Supplement 2 for a discussion on novel linguistic cases, Supplement 3 for practical implementation examples, and Supplement 7 for analysis of computational complexity across different case assignments.
