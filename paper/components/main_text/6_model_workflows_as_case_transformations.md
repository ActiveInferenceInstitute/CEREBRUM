## Model Workflows as Case Transformations

## Computational Linguistics, Structural Alignment, and Model Relationships
CEREBRUM implements multiple alignment systems for model relationships, mirroring linguistic morphosyntactic structures. These alignment patterns determine how models interact and transform based on their functional roles.

Figures 9 and 10 provide complementary perspectives on alignment patterns:

* Figure 9 illustrates theoretical alignment patterns derived from linguistic theory (nominative-accusative, ergative-absolutive, and tripartite), showing the conceptual organization of models based on their case relationships.
* Figure 10 demonstrates practical computational implementation of these patterns, including specific resource allocation strategies, message passing protocols, and transformation efficiency considerations.

## Implementation in Intelligence Production
CEREBRUM integrates case transformations into intelligence production workflows through several interconnected frameworks, as detailed in Supplement 3:

* Figure 6 provides the operational overview of intelligence production with case-bearing models.
* Figures 7 and 8 illustrate the category-theoretic foundations that formalize these transformations from complementary mathematical perspectives.
* Figures 11 and 12 visualize alternative state-based transitions of models between cases during intelligence lifecycles.

## Intelligence Production Workflow
The CEREBRUM-managed intelligence production process follows a structured sequence of case transformations:

1. **Data Collection**: Models in instrumental case [INS] function as data collection tools, implementing specific methods for information gathering.

2. **Preprocessing**: Models transition to nominative case [NOM], becoming active agents that clean, normalize, and prepare data for analysis.

3. **Analysis**: Models transform to locative case [LOC], providing essential contextual understanding and defining environmental parameters that shape analytical processes.

4. **Integration**: Models assume genitive case [GEN], generating intelligence products by synthesizing information from multiple sources and previous stages.

5. **Evaluation**: Products undergo assessment by models in accusative case [ACC], which evaluate quality, accuracy, and relevance, identifying improvement areas.

6. **Refinement**: Models in dative case [DAT] receive feedback from evaluation and implement necessary adjustments to intelligence products or underlying analyses.

7. **Deployment**: Models return to nominative case [NOM] for active implementation or dissemination of refined intelligence solutions.

This systematic workflow demonstrates how case transformations enable models to maintain core identity while adapting to different functional requirements throughout the intelligence lifecycle. Each case assignment optimizes specific aspects of model behavior—from data collection and processing to product generation and quality assessment—creating a structured approach to managing intelligence workflows. Supplement 11 provides formal mathematical descriptions of these transformations, while Supplement 7 analyzes their computational complexity.
