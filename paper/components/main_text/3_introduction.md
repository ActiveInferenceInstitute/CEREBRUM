## Introduction


## Cognitive Systems Modeling
Cognitive systems modeling approaches cognition as a complex adaptive system, where cognitive processes emerge from the dynamic interaction of multiple components across different scales. This perspective draws from ecological psychology's emphasis on organism-environment coupling, where cognitive processes are fundamentally situated in and shaped by their environmental context. The 4E cognition framework (embodied, embedded, enacted, and extended) provides a theoretical foundation for understanding how cognitive systems extend beyond individual agents to include environmental structures and social interactions. In this view, cognitive models are not merely internal representations but active participants in a broader cognitive ecosystem, where they adapt and evolve through interaction with other models and environmental constraints. This systems-level perspective is particularly relevant for intelligence production, where multiple analytical models must coordinate their activities while maintaining sensitivity to changing operational contexts and requirements. The complex adaptive systems approach emphasizes self-organization, emergence, and adaptation, viewing cognitive processes as distributed across multiple interacting components that collectively produce intelligent behavior through their coordinated activity (including language use).

## Active Inference
Active Inference is a first-principles account of perception, learning, and decision-making based on the Free Energy Principle. In this framework, cognitive systems minimize variational free energy  bounded surprise, reflecting the difference between an organism's internal model and its environment  through perception (updating internal models) and action (changing action and ultimately sensory inputs). The Active Inference framework formalizes uncertainty in terms of entropy and precision weighting, enabling dynamic adaptive processes. While many model architectures are possible, hierarchical message passing is a common implementation that implements predictions as top-down flows and prediction errors as bottom-up flows, creating a bidirectional inference system that iteratively minimizes surprise across model levels. Active Inference treats all cognitive operations as Bayesian model update, providing a unifying mathematical formalism for predictive cognition.

## Linguistic Case Systems
Linguistic case systems represent grammatical relationships between words through morphological marking. Case systems operate as morphosyntactic interfaces between semantics and syntax, encoding contextualized relationship types rather than just sequential ordering. This inherent relationality makes case systems powerful abstractions for modeling complex dependencies and transformations between conceptual entities. Cases under consideration here include nominative (subject), accusative (object), dative (recipient), genitive (possessor), instrumental (tool), locative (location), and ablative (origin), all serving different functional roles within sentence structures. Languages implement these differently: nominative-accusative systems distinguish subjects from objects, while ergative-absolutive systems group intransitive subjects with direct objects.  While English has largely lost its morphological case system, the underlying case relationships still exist and are expressed through word order and prepositions. For example, in "The cat chased the mouse," the nominative case is marked by position (subject before verb) rather than morphology, while in "I gave him the book," the dative case is marked by the preposition "to" (implied) and word order. This demonstrates that (the semantics/semiosis/pragmatics of) case relationships are fundamental to language structure, even when not overtly marked morphologically (e.g. expressed in writing or spoken language).

## Intelligence Case Management Systems
Intelligence case management systems organize investigative workflows and analytical processes in operational contexts. These systems structure information collection, analysis, evaluation, and dissemination while tracking provenance and relationships between intelligence products. Modern implementations increasingly must manage complex model ecosystems where analytical tools, data sources, and products interact within organizational workflows. However, current frameworks lack formal mathematical foundations for representing model relationships, leading to ad hoc integration approaches that become unwieldy at scale. As artificial intelligence components proliferate in these systems, a more rigorous basis for model interaction becomes essential for maintaining operational coherence and analytical integrity.

## Towards Languages for Generative Modeling
The Active Inference community has extensively explored numerous adjectival modifications of the base framework, including Deep, Affective, Branching-Time, Quantum, Mortal, Structured Inference, among others. Each adjectival-prefixed variant emphasizes specific architectural aspects or extensions of the core formalism. Building on this, CEREBRUM focuses on a wider range of linguistic formalism (e.g. in this paper, declensional semantics) rather than adjectival modifications.
In this first CEREBRUM paper, there is an emphasis on the declensional aspects of generative models as noun-like entities, separate from adjectival qualification. This approach aligns with category theoretic approaches to linguistics, where morphisms between objects formalize grammatical relationships and transformations. By applying formal case grammar to generative models, CEREBRUM extends and transposes structured modeling approaches to ecosystems of shared intelligence, while preserving the underlying (partitioned, flexible, variational, composable, interfacial, inter-active, empirical, applicable, communicable) semantics.

## Conceptual Foundations: The Intersection of Four Domains
CEREBRUM integrates four key domains to create a unified framework for model management (@fig:fig1):

![Conceptual Foundations of CEREBRUM.](Figure_1.png){#fig:fig1}

1. **Cognitive Systems Modeling** offers the entities that take on case relationships
2. **Active Inference** supplies the predictive processing mechanics that drive case transformations
3. **Linguistic Case Systems** provide the grammatical metaphor for how models relate to each other
4. **Intelligence Production** furnishes the practical application context and workflows
