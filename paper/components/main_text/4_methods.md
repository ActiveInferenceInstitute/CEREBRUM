## Methods

## Formal Framework Development
The CEREBRUM framework emerged from a synthesis of linguistic theory, cognitive science, category theory, and operations research. Key methodological approaches included:

1. **Linguistic Formalization**: Adapting morphosyntactic case theory into computational representations through abstract algebraic structures. This process formalized case relationships as mathematical operators that transform model properties while preserving essential characteristics.

2. **Category-Theoretic Mapping**: Implementing category theory to formalize morphisms between case states as functorial transformations. This approach enabled rigorous tracking of identity preservation across transformations while verifying compositional consistency, as formalized in Figure 7.

3. **Algorithmic Implementation**: Developing algorithmic specifications for case transformations compliant with the Free Energy Principle. These algorithms define concrete computational procedures for implementing case transitions in operational systems.

4. **Variational Methods**: Applying variational free energy calculations to optimize model inference and structural transformations. This connects case transitions to information-theoretic optimization principles, ensuring computational efficiency, as detailed in Supplement 11.

## Mathematical Foundation
The mathematical foundation of CEREBRUM builds on formalizations of case transformations using category theory and variational inference. Case transformations operate as morphisms in a category where objects represent models with specific case assignments. The framework employs metrics including Kullback-Leibler divergence, Fisher information, and Lyapunov functions to quantify transformation efficacy and system stability. This approach provides both theoretical guarantees of compositional consistency and practical optimization methods for computational implementation, with formal definitions provided in Supplement 9.

## Core Concept: Cognitive Models as Case-Bearing Entities
CEREBRUM's central innovation is the formalization of cognitive models as case-bearing entities that transform systematically based on their functional relationships. Just as nouns in morphologically rich languages take different forms based on grammatical function, cognitive models in CEREBRUM exist in different "states" or "cases" depending on their relationships to other models within the system. Figure 2 illustrates this linguistic parallel.

The core framework organizes cognitive models according to their case relationships, as shown in Figure 3, which maps primary case assignments and their functional roles. This structured approach enables precise transformations between model states while maintaining identity persistence across functional transitions.

The implementation of this core concept extends across multiple domains and applications, with specific mathematical formulations provided in Supplement 11 and practical applications demonstrated in Supplement 3. The case framework not only formalizes existing model relationships but also opens new possibilities for model composition and transformation that align with natural language structures, creating a systematic foundation for complex model ecosystems.
