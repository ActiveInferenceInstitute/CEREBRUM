## Methods

## Formal Framework Development
The CEREBRUM framework was developed as a part of a broader synthetic intelligence framework, combining linguistic theory, cognitive science, category theory, and operations research. Key methodological approaches included:
1. **Linguistic Formalization**: Adapting morphosyntactic case theory into computational representations through abstract algebraic structures.
2. **Category-Theoretic Mapping**: Implementing category theory to formalize morphisms between case states as functorial transformations.
3. **Algorithmic Implementation**: Developing algorithmic specifications for case transformations compliant with the Free Energy Principle.
4. **Variational Methods**: Applying variational free energy calculations to optimize model inference as well as structural transformations.

## Mathematical Foundation
The mathematical foundation of CEREBRUM builds on formalizations of case transformations using category theory and variational inference. Case transformations are modeled as morphisms in a category where objects are models with specific case assignments. The framework employs metrics including Kullback-Leibler divergence, Fisher information, and Lyapunov functions to quantify transformation efficacy and system stability. This approach provides both theoretical guarantees of compositional consistency and practical optimization methods for computational implementation.

## Core Concept: Cognitive Models as Case-Bearing Entities
Just as nouns in morphologically rich languages take different forms based on their grammatical function, cognitive models in CEREBRUM can exist in different "states" or "cases" depending on how they relate to other models or processes within the system. @fig:fig2 illustrates this linguistic parallel.

The core framework of CEREBRUM organizes cognitive models according to their case relationships, as shown in @fig:fig3, which maps out the primary case assignments and their functional roles.
