## Abstract

CEREBRUM implements a comprehensive approach to cognitive systems modeling by applying linguistic case systems to model management. This framework treats cognitive models as entities that can exist in different "cases", as in a morphologically rich language, based on their functional role within an intelligence production workflow. This enables more structured representation of model relationships and transformations.
