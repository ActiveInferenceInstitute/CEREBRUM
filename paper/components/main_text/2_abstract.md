## Abstract

CEREBRUM implements a case-based approach to cognitive systems modeling by applying linguistic case frameworks to model management. The framework treats cognitive models as entities that can exist in different "cases"—analogous to nouns in morphologically rich languages—based on their functional roles within intelligence production workflows. This linguistic paradigm enables structured representation of model relationships and transformations through principled mathematical formulations. The immediate benefits include enhanced interoperability between models, reduced complexity in managing model ecosystems, and improved alignment between computational infrastructure and human cognitive patterns.
