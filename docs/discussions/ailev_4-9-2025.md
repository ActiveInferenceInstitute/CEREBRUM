Поэтому сначала задача, а потом можно подумать — интересно ли тратить силы на её решение, знакомство с альтернативными решениями, пробовать новые подходы к решению. Я не слышал ничего, что работа по описанию падежей нужна хоть кому-нибудь сегодня: сегодня всё это отлично описывается нейросетями.

So if there's no meaningful task yet, then it's not interesting. Therefore, first there needs to be a task, and then we can think about whether it's interesting to spend effort on solving it, getting familiar with alternative solutions, and trying new approaches to solving it. I haven't heard anything that suggests work on describing cases is needed by anyone today: today all of this is perfectly described by neural networks.

# Response (April 9, 2025)

One of the first problems I used this method to address, is describing and refining the way even a single generative model is used across stages of intelligence production pipeline. 

I continue to develop multiple use cases and specific problems, where cases and other lexical intelligence elements, are proving useful in complement with other tools. I am not sure if/why/where you got the sense this is meant to replace methods like neural networks. Hence I asked if you have other specific tasks, SoTA, benchmarks, etc. that I might be able to explore these methods in the setting of.

So if you have no problems, since things are "perfectly described" already, wonderful. Yet in these inquiries into increased expressivity and applicability of modeling, I have found types of description (such as cases, including novel cases, and others linguistic elements) which I have not seen in any pure probabilistic/inference setting.

Even if neural networks can "perfectly describe" these processes today, CEREBRUM adds crucial value by providing formal linguistic and category theory structures for interpretability and composability. For example talking about a Neural Network as an actor [NOM], recepient of action, [ACC], generator of outputs [GEN], or talking about a location within a neural network [LOC] (critical for the interpretability methods you mention), This enables us to understand and explain how neural networks (and other architectures) work in different contexts, combine them safely, and document their behavior systematically.

CEREBRUM supports specific tasks through case-based lexical intelligence (here simple examples, more unpacked in [speculative design](/docs/speculative_design), [languages](/docs/languages), and [practical applications](/Supplement_C_3_Practical_Applications.md)):
