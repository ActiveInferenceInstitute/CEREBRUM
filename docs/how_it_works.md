# How CEREBRUM Works

CEREBRUM (Case-Enabled Reasoning Engine with Bayesian Representations for Unified Modeling) is a synthetic intelligence framework that integrates linguistic case systems with cognitive scientific principles to create flexible, context-aware models. This document explains the core mechanics of how CEREBRUM works, with links to deeper documentation on specific aspects.

## Core Concept: Modeling with Linguistic Cases

At its heart, CEREBRUM treats cognitive models as case-bearing entities that can flexibly assume different functional roles within a system, similar to how nouns in many languages can be declined into different cases to indicate their grammatical function.

In CEREBRUM, a single model can transform between different cases to serve different functions:
- A model in **nominative case [NOM]** acts as an active predictor
- The same model in **accusative case [ACC]** becomes the object of optimization
- When transformed to **genitive case [GEN]**, it functions as an output generator
- And so on across [eight standard cases](cerebrum_core_spec.md#21-standard-cases)

This linguistic approach enables models to adapt their function contextually without changing their underlying structure, creating a formal system for expressing model interactions and transformations. For language-specific implementations, see [Language Nuance Handling](language_nuance_handling.md).

## Architecture: Five Core Components

CEREBRUM's implementation is built around five key architectural components that work together to enable case-based reasoning:

1. **Model Registry**: Maintains references to all models with their current case assignments
2. **Case Manager**: Handles case transformations and maintains rules governing valid transitions
3. **Precision Allocator**: Implements active inference principles for resource allocation
4. **Message Bus**: Facilitates communication between case-bearing models
5. **Transformation Engine**: Implements actual case transformations

These components are detailed in the [Core Specification](cerebrum_core_spec.md#1-core-components), with technical implementation guides available for [Python, JavaScript, and Rust](language_implementations.md).

## Mathematical Foundation: Free Energy Minimization

CEREBRUM's case transformations are grounded in the Free Energy Principle from neuroscience, treating each transformation as an inference process:

$$F(m, c) = D_{KL}[q(\theta|c) || p(\theta|c)] - \mathbb{E}_q[\ln p(o|\theta, c)]$$

Where:
- $F$ is the free energy
- $m$ is the model
- $c$ is the case
- $D_{KL}$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence
- $q(\theta|c)$ is the approximate posterior over parameters given the case
- $p(\theta|c)$ is the prior over parameters given the case
- $\mathbb{E}_q$ is the expectation under the approximate posterior
- $p(o|\theta, c)$ is the likelihood of observations given parameters and case

Case transformations are driven by free energy minimization, seeking the case that minimizes surprise:

$$c^* = \arg\min_c F(m, c)$$

This formal grounding ensures that transformations are principled and correspond to adaptive behavior. Learn more in [Active Inference Integration](active_inference_integration.md#1-free-energy-minimization-in-case-transformations).

## The Workflow: How Models Interact and Transform

Here's how CEREBRUM works in practice:

1. **Model Registration**: Models are registered with the Model Registry with an initial case assignment
2. **Case Transformation**: Models transform between cases as needed to fulfill different roles
3. **Precision-Weighted Communication**: Models communicate via a message bus with precision weighting
4. **Resource Allocation**: The Precision Allocator optimizes system resources based on case assignments
5. **Hierarchical Processing**: Models organize into hierarchical structures through case relationships

A detailed implementation workflow is available in the [Getting Started Guide](getting_started.md#development-workflow).

## Case-Specific Behaviors

Each model implements case-specific behaviors for prediction and updating:

### Prediction Dynamics

- **Nominative [NOM]**: Generate predictions as an active agent
- **Genitive [GEN]**: Generate outputs as a source/producer
- **Locative [LOC]**: Provide contextual information
- **Instrumental [INS]**: Implement algorithmic transformations

### Update Dynamics

- **Accusative [ACC]**: Update parameters through optimization
- **Dative [DAT]**: Receive and incorporate incoming information
- **Ablative [ABL]**: Derive causal explanations from experiences
- **Vocative [VOC]**: Respond to direct addressing/queries

The specific equations and implementation details are covered in [Active Inference Integration](active_inference_integration.md#3-case-specific-prediction-and-update-equations).

## Practical Implementation

CEREBRUM can be implemented in various programming languages, with reference implementations provided in:
- [Python](language_implementations.md#1-python-implementation)
- [JavaScript](language_implementations.md#2-javascripttypescript-implementation)
- [Rust](language_implementations.md#3-rust-implementation)

To get started with a practical implementation, see the [Getting Started Guide](getting_started.md) which walks through creating a simple temperature model with case transformations.

## Example: A Simple CEREBRUM Model

A simple CEREBRUM model might be a temperature controller that can function in different cases:

- In **nominative case [NOM]**, it actively predicts future temperatures
- In **accusative case [ACC]**, it receives parameter updates from measurements
- In **genitive case [GEN]**, it generates performance reports
- In **instrumental case [INS]**, it acts as a method for temperature regulation

The model transforms between these cases depending on the current context and requirements. See [Model Examples](model_examples.md) for detailed code examples and the [Getting Started Guide](getting_started.md#your-first-cerebrum-model) for implementation details.

## Key Innovations

CEREBRUM introduces several key innovations to cognitive modeling:

1. **Case-Based Role Flexibility**: Models can flexibly change their functional role without changing their core structure
2. **Unified Mathematical Framework**: Free energy minimization provides a consistent mathematical basis for transformations
3. **Precision-Weighted Interactions**: Communication between models is weighted by precision derived from free energy
4. **Linguistic Metaphor**: Using linguistic cases provides an intuitive and expressive framework for model relationships
5. **Compositional Intelligence**: Case relationships enable complex compositional structures of interacting models

## Integration with Active Inference

CEREBRUM deeply integrates with Active Inference principles, using:

- **Free Energy Minimization**: To drive case transformations
- **Precision Weighting**: To modulate message passing between models
- **Hierarchical Message Passing**: To enable complex model hierarchies
- **Prediction Error Minimization**: To optimize model parameters

## Implementation Roadmap

CEREBRUM is being implemented in phases according to the [Implementation Roadmap](implementation_roadmap.md):

2. **Phase 2**: Reference model implementations
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced case relationship handling
