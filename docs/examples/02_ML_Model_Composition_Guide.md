# CEREBRUM Guide: Machine Learning Model Composition

## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to apply CEREBRUM (Case-Enabled Reasoning Engine with Bayesian Representations for Unified Modeling) to compose machine learning models into coherent systems. By treating models as case-bearing entities, we can formalize their relationships and compose them following principled rules.

## Core Principles of CEREBRUM Model Composition

1. **Models as Case-Bearing Entities**: Treat each ML model as an entity that can assume different case roles
2. **Compositional Morphisms**: Define transformations between cases as morphisms in a category
3. **Precision-Weighted Interfaces**: Adjust connection strengths based on case alignments
4. **Formal Case Calculus**: Follow mathematical rules when composing models

## Case-Based Model Composition Patterns

### Pattern 1: Pipeline Composition [NOM] → [DAT]

When composing models in sequence, connect a model in nominative case (active predictor) to a model in dative case (receiver):

```python
# Define models with their primary cases
feature_extractor = Model("resnet50")[NOM]  # Active predictor
classifier = Model("mlp")[DAT]  # Receiver of features

# Create pipeline through case-based composition
pipeline = compose(feature_extractor, classifier)  # Implicit [NOM] → [DAT] connection
```

### Pattern 2: Ensemble Composition [NOM] + [NOM] → [ACC] → [NOM]

When creating ensembles, multiple nominative models feed into an aggregator in accusative case:

```python
# Define base models in nominative case
model1 = Model("randomforest")[NOM]
model2 = Model("xgboost")[NOM]
model3 = Model("neuralnet")[NOM]

# Define aggregator in accusative case (receiving updates)
aggregator = Model("weightedaverage")[ACC]

# Create ensemble through case composition
ensemble = compose_ensemble([model1, model2, model3], aggregator)
# Aggregator transforms to nominative for final prediction
ensemble.predict = aggregator[NOM].predict
```

### Pattern 3: Hierarchical Composition [LOC] ⊃ ([NOM] → [DAT])

For hierarchical models, use locative case to provide context for nested compositions:

```python
# Define context model in locative case
context_model = Model("context_encoder")[LOC]

# Define models that operate within this context
within_context_model1 = Model("task_specific1")[NOM]
within_context_model2 = Model("task_specific2")[DAT]

# Compose with context
hierarchical_model = compose_with_context(
    context_model,
    compose(within_context_model1, within_context_model2)
)
```

## Practical Implementation

### Example: Computer Vision Pipeline with CEREBRUM

```python
import torch
from cerebrum import CerebrumModel, compose, case_transform

# Define feature extractor with primary nominative case
feature_extractor = CerebrumModel(
    model=torch.hub.load('pytorch/vision', 'resnet18', pretrained=True),
    name="ResNet18FeatureExtractor",
    primary_case="NOM"  # Active predictor
)

# Define classifier with primary dative case
classifier = CerebrumModel(
    model=torch.nn.Linear(512, 10),
    name="ImageClassifier",
    primary_case="DAT"  # Receiver
)

# Create pipeline through case-aware composition
vision_pipeline = compose(
    feature_extractor,  # [NOM] → Generates features
    classifier           # [DAT] → Receives features
)

# For inference, maintain the case flow
def predict(image):
    # Feature extractor remains in nominative case
    features = feature_extractor[NOM].forward(image)
    
    # Transform classifier to nominative for final prediction
    final_output = classifier[NOM].forward(features)
    
    return final_output

# During training, transform cases accordingly
def train_step(image, target):
    # Feature extraction in nominative
    features = feature_extractor[NOM].forward(image)
    
    # Classification in nominative
    output = classifier[NOM].forward(features)
    loss = criterion(output, target)
    
    # Backpropagation transforms models to accusative case
    classifier[ACC].update(loss)
    feature_extractor[ACC].update(loss)
    
    return loss
```

### Example: Multi-Modal Fusion with CEREBRUM

```python
# Define modality-specific encoders
vision_encoder = CerebrumModel(vision_model, "VisionEncoder", "NOM")
text_encoder = CerebrumModel(text_model, "TextEncoder", "NOM")
audio_encoder = CerebrumModel(audio_model, "AudioEncoder", "NOM")

# Define fusion model in dative case (receives multiple inputs)
fusion_model = CerebrumModel(fusion_network, "MultiModalFusion", "DAT")

# Compose multi-modal system
multimodal_system = compose_multi(
    {"vision": vision_encoder, "text": text_encoder, "audio": audio_encoder},
    fusion_model
)

# For inference
def multimodal_predict(vision_input, text_input, audio_input):
    # Encoders in nominative case
    vision_features = vision_encoder[NOM].encode(vision_input)
    text_features = text_encoder[NOM].encode(text_input)
    audio_features = audio_encoder[NOM].encode(audio_input)
    
    # Fusion in dative case to receive multiple inputs
    combined = fusion_model[DAT].fuse({
        "vision": vision_features,
        "text": text_features,
        "audio": audio_features
    })
    
    # Transform to nominative for final prediction
    result = fusion_model[NOM].predict(combined)
    
    return result
```

## Case-Specific Model Properties

When composing models, respect their case-specific properties:

| Case | Interface Priority | Parameter Access | Message Passing | Composition Rules |
|------|-------------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **[NOM]** | Output interfaces | Read-only parameters | Generates predictions | Can connect to [DAT], [ACC] |
| **[ACC]** | Update interfaces | Writable parameters | Receives gradients | Can connect from [NOM], [GEN] |
| **[DAT]** | Input interfaces | Read-only parameters | Receives data | Can connect from [NOM], [GEN], [ABL] |
| **[GEN]** | Product interfaces | Read-only parameters | Generates products | Can connect to [DAT], [ACC] |
| **[INS]** | Method interfaces | Execution parameters | Implements procedures | Can be used by any case |
| **[LOC]** | Context interfaces | Context parameters | Provides environment | Contains other compositions |
| **[ABL]** | Origin interfaces | Historical parameters | Provides attribution | Can connect to [DAT] |
| **[VOC]** | Command interfaces | Identity parameters | Receives commands | Directly addressable by name |

## Advanced Composition Examples

### Composition with Case Transformation

Sometimes models need to transform cases during composition:

```python
# Initial case assignment
model_a = CerebrumModel(network_a, "ModelA", "GEN")  # Generator
model_b = CerebrumModel(network_b, "ModelB", "NOM")  # Predictor

# For composition, model_a needs to be in nominative case
composed_model = compose(
    case_transform(model_a, "GEN", "NOM"),  # Transform from generator to predictor
    model_b  # Already in compatible case
)
```

### Bidirectional Composition

For models that communicate bidirectionally:

```python
# Define models
encoder = CerebrumModel(encoder_network, "Encoder", "NOM")
decoder = CerebrumModel(decoder_network, "Decoder", "DAT")

# Bidirectional composition requires explicit case flows
autoencoder = compose_bidirectional(
    forward_flow={"encoder": encoder[NOM], "decoder": decoder[DAT]},
    backward_flow={"decoder": decoder[ACC], "encoder": encoder[ACC]}
)
```

## Best Practices for CEREBRUM Model Composition

1. **Respect Case Compatibility**: Ensure composed models have compatible cases
2. **Document Case Transitions**: Clear documentation of when and why models transform cases
3. **Maintain Case Consistency**: Use consistent case assignments for similar functional roles
4. **Optimize Precision Weights**: Tune connection strengths based on empirical performance
5. **Test Case Transformations**: Verify that models behave as expected in each case

## Troubleshooting Common Composition Issues

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Dimension mismatch | Case incompatibility | Transform source to [NOM] and target to [DAT] |
| Gradient flow problems | Incorrect case during backprop | Ensure models transform to [ACC] during updates |
| Resource contention | Multiple [NOM] models competing | Use [LOC] case to provide resource context |
| Interface conflicts | Incompatible message passing | Explicitly define interfaces for each case |
| Unexpected behavior | Implicit case transformation | Explicitly document all case transitions |

## Conclusion

The CEREBRUM framework provides a principled approach to model composition by formalizing the functional roles models play within a system. By treating models as case-bearing entities, developers can create more robust, interpretable, and maintainable model ecosystems.
