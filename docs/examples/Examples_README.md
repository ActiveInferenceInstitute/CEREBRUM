## Using These Examples

These examples are designed to demonstrate the practical application of CEREBRUM's case-based approach to different AI and machine learning contexts. Each example includes:

1. **Conceptual Overview**: How CEREBRUM's case system applies to the specific domain
2. **Component Mappings**: How domain-specific elements map to linguistic cases
3. **Workflow Definitions**: How case transformations enable structured workflows
4. **Implementation Patterns**: Practical code examples showing CEREBRUM in action
5. **Best Practices**: Guidelines for effective use of the framework

## Case Roles in CEREBRUM

All examples utilize CEREBRUM's eight core case roles that models can assume:

| Case | Abbreviation | Function | Example |
|------|--------------|----------|---------|
| Nominative | [NOM] | Active agent generating predictions | Model actively predicting outcomes |
| Accusative | [ACC] | Object receiving updates/changes | Model being trained or fine-tuned |
| Genitive | [GEN] | Source/generator of outputs | Model generating reports or derived data |
| Dative | [DAT] | Recipient of data flows | Model receiving input streams |
| Instrumental | [INS] | Tool implementing methods | Model used as computational tool |
| Locative | [LOC] | Context provider | Model providing environmental parameters |
| Ablative | [ABL] | Origin of information | Model providing historical/causal data |
| Vocative | [VOC] | Addressable interface | Model with command/API interface |

## Getting Started

To begin using these examples:

1. Read the [CEREBRUM.md](../CEREBRUM.md) document to understand the core framework concepts
2. Choose an example most relevant to your use case
3. Adapt the patterns and workflows to your specific project needs
4. Refer to the documentation template for comprehensive project documentation
