## Using These Examples

These examples are designed to demonstrate the practical application of CEREBRUM's case-based approach to different AI and machine learning contexts. They illustrate how to structure complex systems, manage data flows, and reason about component interactions using the case grammar. Each example includes:

1. **Conceptual Overview**: How CEREBRUM's case system provides a semantic framework for the specific domain (e.g., NLP, Agent Design).
2. **Component Mappings**: Concrete examples of mapping domain-specific elements (e.g., models, data stores, APIs) to linguistic cases, defining their roles and relationships.
3. **Workflow Definitions**: Step-by-step descriptions of how case transformations model system processes, data pipelines, or agent decision loops.
4. **Implementation Patterns**: Pseudo-code or descriptive examples of how CEREBRUM concepts translate into code structure, API design, or configuration, often referencing specific libraries or architectural patterns (e.g., microservices, dataflow graphs).
5. **Technical Considerations**: Discussion of relevant technical aspects like performance optimization, error handling, scalability, and integration with existing tools or platforms.
6. **Best Practices**: Guidelines for applying the CEREBRUM framework effectively within the specific technical context.

## Case Roles in CEREBRUM

All examples utilize CEREBRUM's eight core case roles that models can assume:

| Case | Abbreviation | Function | Example |
|------|--------------|----------|---------|
| Nominative | [NOM] | Active agent generating predictions | Model actively predicting outcomes |
| Accusative | [ACC] | Object receiving updates/changes | Model being trained or fine-tuned |
| Genitive | [GEN] | Source/generator of outputs | Model generating reports or derived data |
| Dative | [DAT] | Recipient of data flows | Model receiving input streams |
| Instrumental | [INS] | Tool implementing methods | Model used as computational tool |
| Locative | [LOC] | Context provider | Model providing environmental parameters |
| Ablative | [ABL] | Origin of information | Model providing historical/causal data |
| Vocative | [VOC] | Addressable interface | Model with command/API interface |
