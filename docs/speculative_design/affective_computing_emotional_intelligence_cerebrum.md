# Affective Computing & Emotional Intelligence Systems: CEREBRUM Integration

## 1. Introduction to Computational Emotionality

Affective computing represents the study and development of systems that can recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human affects. This document outlines a comprehensive framework for integrating emotional intelligence into the CEREBRUM ecosystem, establishing a theoretical and practical foundation for machines that can not only process emotional information but participate in emotional exchanges with humans and other systems.

## 2. Theoretical Foundations

### 2.1 Models of Emotion

The CEREBRUM affective computing framework draws from multiple theoretical models:

* **Dimensional Models**: Representing emotions along continuous dimensions (valence, arousal, dominance)
* **Discrete Emotion Theory**: Categorizing emotions into fundamental types (joy, anger, fear, etc.)
* **Appraisal Theory**: Modeling emotions as arising from cognitive evaluations of events
* **Constructionist Approaches**: Viewing emotions as constructed from more basic psychological processes
* **Somatic Marker Hypothesis**: Integrating bodily responses into emotional processing

### 2.2 Affective Neuroscience Principles

Key neurobiological insights inform the architecture:

* **Limbic System Integration**: Modeling interconnected emotion processing circuits
* **Neuromodulator Dynamics**: Simulating effects of dopamine, serotonin, and other modulators
* **Interoceptive Processing**: Integrating internal state monitoring into emotional awareness
* **Prefrontal-Limbic Interactions**: Balancing emotional responses with cognitive control
* **Mirror Neuron Emulation**: Facilitating emotional contagion and empathic responses
