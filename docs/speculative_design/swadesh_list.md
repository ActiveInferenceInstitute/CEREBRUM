# CEREBRUM/FORMICA Swadesh List (Speculative - 207 Items)

This list presents speculative translations of the **207-item** Swadesh list concepts into two hypothetical "languages" derived from the CEREBRUM project themes:
- **CEREBRUM:** Terms related to cognitive architecture, information processing, and abstract representation.
- **FORMICA:** Terms related to collective intelligence, social structures, biology, and nature, drawing inspiration from ant colonies.

A **Case/Type Annotation** column attempts to classify the core concept (e.g., Noun-Entity, Verb-Action, Adjective-Property) to aid in understanding its potential role within a structured representation like CEREBRUM's cases.
