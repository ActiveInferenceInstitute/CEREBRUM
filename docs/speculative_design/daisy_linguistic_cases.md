# The Case of the Declined Cognitive Model

"I say, Alec darling, have you ever thought about how your detective work resembles a rather fascinating framework I just read about?" Daisy Dalrymple Fletcher arranged herself more comfortably in the armchair by the fire at their London flat, setting aside a thick academic paper.

Detective Chief Inspector Alec Fletcher of Scotland Yard looked up from his newspaper with a raised eyebrow. "And what framework might that be, my dear?"

"It's called CEREBRUM—Case-Enabled Reasoning Engine with Bayesian Representations for Unified Modeling. Professor Enderby was explaining it at Lady Winthrop's literary salon yesterday."

"Good heavens, Daisy! What on earth were you doing discussing Bayesian representations at a literary salon?"

"Well, it wasn't entirely my fault. I was meant to be gathering material for my article on modern country house libraries, but Professor Enderby cornered me by the punch bowl." Daisy waved her hand dismissively. "But listen, darling—it's absolutely marvelous how similar your detective methods are to this cognitive framework!"

Tom Tring, Alec's reliable sergeant who had stopped by to deliver case files, cleared his throat from the doorway. "Begging your pardon, but what's this about cases, Mrs. Fletcher?"

"Not your sort of cases, Tom—well, not exactly." Daisy sat forward eagerly. "CEREBRUM treats cognitive models as entities that can exist in different 'cases,' rather like nouns in morphologically rich languages. Do you remember your declensions from school, Alec?"

"Vaguely," Alec admitted reluctantly. "Nominative, accusative, and so forth?"

"Precisely! Now imagine your detective work with each aspect playing a different grammatical role. The nominative case is the subject—that's you, darling, as the active investigator generating predictions. The accusative is the direct object—the suspect being questioned. The dative is the indirect object—perhaps the witness receiving your attention."

Lady Marjorie, Daisy's formidable mother-in-law who had arrived unannounced as usual, settled herself by the fire. "This reminds me of my Hungarian governess. Hungarian has a remarkable case system—seventeen cases, I believe—particularly fascinating for describing relationships to surfaces."

"Oh, how perfectly marvelous!" Daisy exclaimed. "Professor Enderby mentioned that very thing! The Hungarian surface cases—superessive, sublative, and delative—are especially relevant to something called the Markov Blanket in the Free Energy Principle."

"The what in the what?" Alec looked increasingly bewildered.

"The Markov Blanket is like a boundary between internal and external states in a system," Daisy explained, warming to her subject. "Think of it as the surface where your investigation meets the external world of evidence. The Hungarian superessive case—'on' the surface—represents the boundary itself. The sublative case—'onto' the surface—represents information arriving at the boundary. And the delative case—'from' the surface—represents information departing from the boundary."

"Like how witness testimony arrives 'onto' your investigation," Tom offered, "and your deductions flow 'from' your investigation?"

"Exactly!" Daisy beamed. "You're splendid at this, Tom!"

Miss Murgatroyd, their elderly neighbor who had come to borrow sugar and now stood fascinated in the doorway, piped up. "This reminds me of my time in Finland. The Finnish have such a beautiful relationship with place—'paikka'—and networks—'verkosto.' Their language is full of concepts about boundaries, edges, and the spaces between."

"Indeed!" Daisy turned excitedly. "Finnish concepts like 'reuna' for edge and 'raja' for boundary align perfectly with the Markov Blanket idea. And their strong sense of place—reflected in their many locative cases—offers a model for contextual awareness in cognitive systems."

Lucy, their maid, entered with a tea tray. "Begging your pardon, but this reminds me of my cousin who worked for that American family with Navajo connections. She was forever going on about how their language sees actions so differently—not just when things happen but how they unfold."

"The Navajo aspect system!" Daisy clapped her hands in delight. "It's another key component! The Navajo language has this remarkably sophisticated way of viewing actions through different perspectives—momentaneous versus continuative, imperfective versus perfective. It's like having multiple camera angles on the same event!"

"Rather like viewing a crime from different witnesses' perspectives," Alec murmured, despite himself becoming interested.

"Precisely, darling! And the Navajo classifier stems—Ø, Ł, D, and L—encode different viewpoints on action properties. The Ł-classifier often represents causative actions—making something happen—while the D-classifier frequently marks reflexive or reciprocal perspectives."

"So when I interrogate a suspect," Alec said slowly, "I'm using a causative perspective—the Ł-classifier—trying to make something happen."

"And when suspects start contradicting themselves," Tom added, "that's like the D-classifier—a reflexive action!"

"You've got it!" Daisy exclaimed. "Now, combine all three frameworks—CEREBRUM's case system, Hungarian surface cases, Navajo aspects, and Finnish place concepts—and you have a comprehensive model for understanding complex cognitive processes!"

Professor Enderby himself, who had come to return a book and been shown in by Lucy, cleared his throat from the doorway. "I say, Mrs. Fletcher, you've grasped these concepts remarkably well!"

"Oh, Professor! How fortuitous!" Daisy gestured to a seat. "I was just explaining to Alec how his detective work exemplifies all these frameworks."

"Most fascinating," the Professor said, accepting a cup of tea from Lucy. "And have you considered how this applies to your current murder investigation, Inspector Fletcher?"

Alec sighed. "We have a strangled duchess and three suspects—the jealous husband, the disinherited nephew, and the scorned lady's maid."

"Perfect!" Professor Enderby's eyes lit up. "Let's apply our frameworks. In CEREBRUM terms, each suspect starts in the accusative case—objects of your investigation. Your theories are in the nominative case—actively generating predictions. Evidence is in the dative case—receiving your analytical attention."

"And in Hungarian surface terms," Lady Marjorie added with unexpected enthusiasm, "your investigation is the surface. The evidence arrives 'onto' your investigation—sublative case—while your deductions move 'from' your investigation—delative case—to form conclusions."

"Meanwhile," Daisy continued, "the Navajo aspect system helps us view the murder itself differently. The momentaneous aspect sees it as a point-like event—the moment of strangulation. The continuative aspect views it as an extended process—the entire sequence from motive to opportunity to action."

"And the Finnish concepts," Miss Murgatroyd chimed in, "remind us of the importance of place—'paikka'—where the murder occurred, the boundaries—'raja'—between suspects and victim, and the resilience—'sisu'—needed to pursue justice!"

"What's more," Daisy added excitedly, "these frameworks apply differently as your investigation progresses. Initially, all suspects are in the accusative case. But as evidence accumulates, one suspect shifts to the nominative case—becoming the active agent you believe committed the murder. The others might shift to the ablative case—representing the origin of false leads!"

"I never thought Latin grammar would help me solve murders," muttered Alec, but there was an undeniable glint of interest in his eyes.

Ernie Piper, Alec's other detective sergeant who had just arrived, looked bewildered. "Sorry to interrupt, but we've got a new lead, sir. The duchess's jade necklace has been found in the lady's maid's quarters."

"Aha!" Daisy exclaimed. "A transformation in the case framework! The lady's maid shifts from accusative to nominative—from object of investigation to subject of guilt!"

"Not necessarily," Alec cautioned. "It could be planted evidence—in which case the necklace itself would be in the instrumental case—the tool by which someone is attempting to frame the maid."

"Splendid application, Inspector!" Professor Enderby applauded. "And how would you view this through the Navajo classifier system?"

Alec considered. "If the maid is guilty, she used the Ł-classifier—the causative—to commit the murder. But if she's being framed, she's in the D-classifier position—the passive recipient of someone else's action."

"And in Finnish terms," Lady Marjorie added, "we must consider the network—'verkosto'—of relationships between all parties, and the boundaries—'raja'—that were crossed."

"This is why your investigations are so successful, Chief," Tom said admiringly. "You naturally implement these frameworks—transforming models between cases, viewing events through multiple aspects, and understanding the importance of boundaries and place."

"I'm merely doing my job," Alec said modestly. "But I must admit, these frameworks do offer an interesting perspective on investigative methodology."

"More than interesting," Professor Enderby insisted. "They provide a formal mathematical foundation for the intuitive processes you already employ. The Expected Free Energy formulation in Active Inference precisely describes how you select investigative policies based on both pragmatic value—solving the case—and epistemic value—gathering information."

"And your interrogation techniques," Daisy added, "embody the Free Energy Principle perfectly! When a suspect's story doesn't match the evidence, that creates 'surprise' which you minimize either by updating your theory or determining they're lying!"

"Fascinating as this all is," Alec said, rising and reaching for his hat, "we do have a murderer to catch. Coming, Daisy?"

"Wouldn't miss it for the world!" Daisy gathered her coat. "I'll explain temporal depth in policy evaluation on the way!"

As they headed for the door, Professor Enderby called after them, "Remember, Inspector—in Active Inference terms, you're not just solving a case; you're minimizing variational free energy through Bayesian model updates across a carefully partitioned Markov Blanket!"

"I'll bear that in mind," Alec replied dryly, but with a smile.

"And do consider the Finnish concept of 'talkoot'—communal work!" Miss Murgatroyd added. "Your detective team embodies this cooperative approach!"

"One more thing," Lady Marjorie called out. "When interviewing the lady's maid, remember the Navajo vocative case—addressing her directly may yield different results than discussing her in the third person!"

As the door closed behind them, Daisy took Alec's arm. "You know, darling, I think we've just witnessed the perfect integration of CEREBRUM with Hungarian, Navajo, and Finnish linguistic frameworks—all applied to detective work!"

"Heaven help us," Alec murmured, but there was no mistaking the fondness in his voice. "Now tell me more about this Expected Free Energy business. It might actually be useful for the Waverton case..."

"Well," Daisy began enthusiastically as they stepped into the hansom cab, "it all starts with the balance between exploration and exploitation in cognitive systems—rather like how you balance gathering new evidence versus pursuing existing leads..."
