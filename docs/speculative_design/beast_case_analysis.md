BEAST 2 is a cross-platform program for Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of molecular sequences. It estimates rooted, time-measured phylogenies using strict or relaxed molecular clock models. It can be used as a method of reconstructing phylogenies but is also a framework for testing evolutionary hypotheses without conditioning on a single tree topology. BEAST 2 uses Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to average over tree space, so that each tree is weighted proportional to its posterior probability. BEAST 2 includes a graphical user-interface for setting up standard analyses and a suit of programs for analysing the results.

With this description of BEAST, write up a fully technical NSF postdoc proposal, for using CEREBRUM and FORMICA (look them up if you need), to do ancestral state Bayesian phenotypic reconstruction of ancient linguistic elements. We are going way into the past. We will use generative AI as needed for creating fluent text, audio, and visual media given the explicitly probabilistic models and empirical data we will be compiling and inferring on ancient and contemporary languages..
