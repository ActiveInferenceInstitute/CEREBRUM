BEAST 2 is a cross-platform program for Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of molecular sequences. It estimates rooted, time-measured phylogenies using strict or relaxed molecular clock models. It can be used as a method of reconstructing phylogenies but is also a framework for testing evolutionary hypotheses without conditioning on a single tree topology. BEAST 2 uses Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to average over tree space, so that each tree is weighted proportional to its posterior probability. BEAST 2 includes a graphical user-interface for setting up standard analyses and a suit of programs for analysing the results.

With this description of BEAST, write up a fully technical NSF postdoc proposal, for using CEREBRUM and FORMICA (look them up if you need), to do ancestral state Bayesian phenotypic reconstruction of ancient linguistic elements. We are going way into the past. We will use generative AI as needed for creating fluent text, audio, and visual media given the explicitly probabilistic models and empirical data we will be compiling and inferring on ancient and contemporary languages..

**Project Summary:**
This project proposes the development and application of novel computational methods for deep ancestral state reconstruction of linguistic elements, reaching significantly further into the past than current techniques allow. We will leverage the CEREBRUM (Case-Enabled Reasoning Engine with Bayesian Representations for Unified Modeling) cognitive modeling framework, integrating it with a proposed complementary system, FORMICA (FORmal Morphosyntactic Integration and Comparative Analysis), designed for structured linguistic data. This integrated system will perform Bayesian inference on combined datasets of contemporary and ancient linguistic features (phonological, lexical, morphological, syntactic), explicitly modeling uncertainty using phylogenetic comparative methods analogous to those in evolutionary biology (e.g., BEAST 2). A key innovation is the use of generative AI, guided by the probabilistic outputs of our CEREBRUM-FORMICA models, to produce fluent textual, auditory, and visual representations of reconstructed ancient linguistic elements and their hypothesized sociocultural contexts. This research addresses fundamental questions about language evolution, demonstrates the power of integrating Bayesian inference with case-based reasoning for complex historical reconstruction, and pioneers the use of generative AI for visualizing and interacting with deep linguistic prehistory. The project aligns with NSF's goals of advancing fundamental scientific knowledge and developing innovative computational tools.

**Intellectual Merit:**
The intellectual merit lies in:
1.  **Methodological Innovation:** Integrating CEREBRUM's hybrid cognitive architecture (Bayesian representations + case-based reasoning) with FORMICA's focus on structured linguistic forms creates a novel, powerful framework for historical linguistics, moving beyond traditional comparative methods or purely statistical phylogenetic approaches. This explicitly tackles the challenge of integrating diverse, sparse, and uncertain linguistic data types.
2.  **Deep Time Reconstruction:** Applying sophisticated Bayesian phylogenetic comparative methods, inspired by frameworks like BEAST 2 but adapted for linguistic data, allows for the reconstruction of linguistic "phenotypes" (specific features or structures) at significantly greater time depths, explicitly quantifying the high uncertainty inherent in such reconstructions.
3.  **Bridging Inference and Generation:** Pioneering the use of generative AI not merely as a tool, but as an integrated component driven by the probabilistic outputs of rigorous Bayesian inference. This allows for nuanced, data-grounded generation of plausible ancient language snippets (text, audio) and contextual visualizations, moving beyond abstract statistical results.
4.  **Advancing Cognitive and Linguistic Theory:** Providing a computational testbed for hypotheses about language change, the relationship between different linguistic subsystems (e.g., lexicon vs. grammar), and the cognitive constraints shaping language evolution over vast timescales.

**Broader Impacts:**
The broader impacts include:
1.  **Development of Advanced Computational Tools:** Creating the CEREBRUM-FORMICA integrated framework as an open-source tool benefiting historical linguistics, computational anthropology, and cognitive science research.
2.  **Training and Dissemination:** Training the postdoctoral fellow in cutting-edge computational modeling, Bayesian statistics, and AI integration. Disseminating results through high-impact publications, conference presentations, workshops, and public-facing outputs (e.g., interactive web visualizations generated by the AI).
3.  **Interdisciplinary Collaboration:** Fostering collaboration between computer science, linguistics, anthropology, and cognitive science.
4.  **Public Engagement:** Making deep human prehistory more accessible and engaging through AI-generated visualizations and auditory reconstructions of ancient linguistic elements, fostering public interest in language evolution and scientific methodology.
5.  **Data Curation:** Compiling and curating valuable datasets of ancient and contemporary linguistic features suitable for computational analysis.

## Project Description

**(Follows NSF PRFB 15-page limit guidelines - sections below are outlines)**

**1. Introduction and Rationale**
    *   The challenge of deep linguistic reconstruction: limitations of traditional methods, sparsity of ancient data.
    *   The promise of computational phylogenetic comparative methods (analogy to BEAST 2 in biology).
    *   Limitations of purely statistical models for complex, structured linguistic data.
    *   Introduction to CEREBRUM: Case-based reasoning + Bayesian inference for flexible cognitive modeling.
    *   Introduction to FORMICA (proposed): A complementary system focusing on structural linguistic data (phonology, morphology, syntax), potentially using graph-based representations or specialized CBR techniques for linguistic structures.
    *   The synergistic potential: Combining CEREBRUM's flexible reasoning and Bayesian power with FORMICA's structural analysis capabilities.
    *   The transformative role of Generative AI: Moving beyond abstract reconstructions to tangible, multimodal representations guided by probabilistic inference.
    *   Hypothesis: Integrated CEREBRUM-FORMICA modeling, leveraging Bayesian phylogenetics and guided generative AI, can rigorously reconstruct plausible ancient linguistic elements and quantify associated uncertainty at unprecedented time depths.

**2. Research Objectives**
    *   **Objective 1: Develop and Integrate the CEREBRUM-FORMICA Framework.**
        *   Define and implement core FORMICA components for representing and comparing structural linguistic data (e.g., phoneme inventories, morphological paradigms, syntactic patterns).
        *   Develop robust interfaces between CEREBRUM and FORMICA, enabling bidirectional information flow (e.g., Bayesian priors from CEREBRUM informing FORMICA's structural comparisons, case-based structural similarities from FORMICA informing CEREBRUM's models).
        *   Implement Bayesian phylogenetic comparative models within the integrated framework, adapting algorithms (e.g., MCMC) for linguistic feature evolution (lexical replacement, phonological shifts, grammatical changes) under various models (e.g., strict vs. relaxed clocks, discrete trait evolution).
    *   **Objective 2: Compile and Curate Linguistic Data.**
        *   Identify target language families/areas for deep reconstruction (e.g., Indo-European, Afroasiatic, hypothetical Nostratic/Eurasiatic - acknowledging the highly speculative nature).
        *   Gather comprehensive data on phonology, lexicon, morphology, and syntax for relevant contemporary and attested ancient languages from sources like WALS, Glottolog, specialized databases, and primary linguistic descriptions.
        *   Format data for compatibility with the CEREBRUM-FORMICA framework, including representation of uncertainty and variation.
    *   **Objective 3: Perform Ancestral State Reconstruction.**
        *   Apply the integrated framework to the curated data to infer posterior distributions of ancestral linguistic states (phonemes, lexical items, grammatical features) at various nodes in the phylogenetic tree.
        *   Explicitly model uncertainty using Bayesian credible intervals and compare results under different evolutionary models.
        *   Validate the framework on language families with known histories before applying it to deeper, more speculative reconstructions.
    *   **Objective 4: Integrate Generative AI for Representation.**
        *   Develop pipelines connecting the probabilistic outputs (posterior distributions of features) from CEREBRUM-FORMICA to generative AI models (e.g., large language models for text, text-to-speech engines, image generation models).
        *   Implement methods to sample from posterior distributions to guide the generation of plausible textual snippets, phonological realizations (audio), and schematic visual representations of reconstructed elements or associated cultural contexts.
        *   Focus on generating *distributions* of plausible outputs reflecting modeled uncertainty, rather than single deterministic outputs.

**Note on FORMICA:** As FORMICA is presented here as a proposed system complementary to CEREBRUM, its specific implementation details would be a core part of the research. It is envisioned to handle the structured nature of linguistic data, potentially using techniques like:
*   **Graph Representations:** Modeling phonological inventories or syntactic dependencies as graphs.
*   **Sequence Alignment:** Adapting bioinformatics algorithms for comparing morphological paradigms or phonological strings.
*   **Specialized Case-Based Reasoning:** Developing similarity metrics and adaptation rules specifically for linguistic structures within the CEREBRUM framework.
*   **Constraint Satisfaction:** Modeling grammatical rules and constraints.

The integration would allow CEREBRUM's Bayesian engine to reason over probabilities derived from FORMICA's structural analyses, and FORMICA's analyses to be informed by broader contextual information or case-based knowledge managed by CEREBRUM.

**Note on Generative AI:** The AI component is not intended to perform the reconstruction itself but to translate the complex, probabilistic outputs of the CEREBRUM-FORMICA analysis into more intuitive, multimodal formats. This requires careful conditioning of generative models on the inferred posterior distributions of linguistic features. For instance, generating audio would involve mapping inferred phonetic features (and their uncertainties) to parameters of a text-to-speech or vocoder system. Generating text might involve using the LLM to create plausible minimal sentences or phrases consistent with inferred grammatical structures and lexicon, potentially sampled according to probability. Visualizations could represent phylogenetic uncertainty or competing hypotheses about specific features.
