# Speculative Design: Hungarian Surface Cases and the FEP Particular Partition

## 1. Introduction: Concept Overview

This document explores a speculative conceptual mapping between a subset of Hungarian grammatical cases – specifically those denoting location and movement relative to surfaces – and the structure of the Particular Partition (Markov Blanket) within the Free Energy Principle (FEP). The FEP describes how systems maintain their integrity by partitioning states into internal, external, and boundary (blanket) states. We propose that the semantics of Hungarian surface cases (Superessive, Sublative, Delative) offer a compelling linguistic analogy for describing the relationships and information flow *on*, *onto*, and *from* the Markov Blanket, potentially providing a novel descriptive language for total systems modeling within frameworks like CEREBRUM.

The concept draws inspiration from the way these cases precisely articulate interactions with surfaces, mirroring how the Markov Blanket mediates the interaction between a system's internal states and its external environment. This can be viewed through the lens of the blanket acting as an interface, potentially relating to concepts like quantum holographic boundaries where information about different domains is encoded.

## 2. Background: Hungarian Surface Cases

Hungarian grammar features a rich system of noun cases, including several that specify location and movement concerning surfaces. The three primary ones relevant here are:

*   **Superessive Case (`-n`/`-on`/`-en`/`-ön`):** Indicates location *on* a surface. Corresponds roughly to the English preposition "on".
    *   *Example:* `asztalon` (on the table)
    *   *Semantic Core:* Static presence or occurrence located directly upon a boundary/surface.
*   **Sublative Case (`-ra`/`-re`):** Indicates movement *onto* a surface. Corresponds roughly to the English preposition "onto".
    *   *Example:* `asztalra` (onto the table)
    *   *Semantic Core:* Directed movement terminating upon a boundary/surface; arrival.
*   **Delative Case (`-ról`/`-ről`):** Indicates movement *from* or *off* a surface. Corresponds roughly to the English preposition "from" or "off (of)".
    *   *Example:* `asztalról` (from/off the table)
    *   *Semantic Core:* Directed movement originating from a boundary/surface; departure.

These cases provide a precise way to describe the relationship between an entity and a surface boundary.

## 3. Background: FEP & The Particular Partition (Markov Blanket)

The Free Energy Principle posits that any self-organising system that maintains its identity (resists dissipation) must possess a statistical boundary known as a Markov Blanket. This blanket partitions the system's universe of states into:

*   **Internal States (μ):** States within the system boundary, characteristic of the system itself. These states do not directly influence or sense external states, except via the blanket.
*   **External States (ψ):** States outside the system boundary, belonging to the environment. These states are not directly influenced or sensed by internal states, except via the blanket.
*   **Blanket States:** States that constitute the boundary itself. They are typically divided into:
    *   **Sensory States (s):** States influenced by external states but not internal states. They mediate the influence *of* the environment *on* the system.
    *   **Active States (a):** States influenced by internal states but not external states. They mediate the influence *of* the system *on* the environment.

The Markov Blanket, therefore, acts as an interface or surface separating the internal from the external. All information exchange between the internal and external domains *must* pass through this sensory/active interface.

## 4. Proposed Mapping: Hungarian Cases as Interface Descriptors

We propose mapping the three Hungarian surface cases to describe the nature of states or processes relative to the Markov Blanket, conceptualized as the system's 'surface':

*   **Superessive (`-on`/`-en`/`-ön` -> 'ON the Blanket'):**
    *   *Mapping:* Could represent the **existence or state of the blanket states (s, a) themselves**. These states *are* the surface. Alternatively, it could describe a condition or parameter defined *at* the interface boundary.
    *   *Conceptual Analogy:* `Markov-Blanket-on [state/property]` -> A property holding *at* the system-environment interface (e.g., the current sensory input configuration, the current active state setting).
*   **Sublative (`-ra`/`-re` -> 'ONTO the Blanket'):**
    *   *Mapping:* Could represent the **flow of influence arriving *at* the blanket from either side**. This maps naturally to:
        *   External states (ψ) influencing Sensory states (s): Information arriving *onto* the sensory surface from the environment. `Environment-ra SensoryState`.
        *   Internal states (μ) influencing Active states (a): Commands arriving *onto* the active surface from the internal system. `InternalState-ra ActiveState`.
    *   *Conceptual Analogy:* Movement *onto* the boundary; the process of sensation or intention-to-act manifesting at the interface.
*   **Delative (`-ról`/`-ről` -> 'FROM the Blanket'):**
    *   *Mapping:* Could represent the **flow of influence originating *from* the blanket towards either side**. This maps naturally to:
        *   Sensory states (s) influencing Internal states (μ): Information propagating *from* the sensory surface into the internal system for inference. `SensoryState-ról InternalState`.
        *   Active states (a) influencing External states (ψ): Actions propagating *from* the active surface out into the environment. `ActiveState-ról Environment`.
    *   *Conceptual Analogy:* Movement *away from* the boundary; the process of internalizing sensations or externalizing actions.

This creates **three distinct modes of interaction** defined relative to the system's boundary, analogous to the Hungarian cases: being *on* the boundary (Superessive), impinging *onto* the boundary (Sublative), and emanating *from* the boundary (Delative).

## 5. Relation to Holographic Principles (Speculative)

The concept of a boundary or surface (like the Markov Blanket) encoding information about states on either side resonates with holographic principles in physics, where information about a volume can be encoded on its boundary. In this analogy:
*   Sensory states (`s`) encode information about external states (`ψ`) *on* the blanket.
*   Active states (`a`) encode information about internal states' (`μ`) intentions *on* the blanket.
The Hungarian case mapping could provide a linguistic structure to describe the *dynamics* of how this information is projected *onto* (`-ra`/`-re`) and read *from* (`-ról`/`-ről`) this holographic surface/interface.

## 6. Implications for CEREBRUM & Total Systems Modeling

This linguistic analogy, while speculative, could offer benefits:

*   **Conceptual Clarity:** Provides a potentially intuitive vocabulary for discussing the distinct roles of different information flows across system boundaries.
*   **Model Specification:** Might inspire notation or DSL elements within CEREBRUM for defining how different model components interface via the blanket (e.g., `ExternalSource -ra SensoryInput`, `InternalBelief -ról ActionCommand`).
*   **Visualization:** Could inform ways to visualize models, emphasizing the boundary and using visual cues related to 'on', 'onto', and 'from' to depict state relationships and information flow.
*   **Formalism:** Encourages thinking about the interface dynamics in a structured, case-like manner.

## 7. Discussion

**Advantages:**
*   Novel conceptual framework linking linguistics and systems theory (FEP).
*   Highlights the crucial role of the interface (blanket).
*   Potentially intuitive way to categorize boundary interactions.

**Disadvantages:**
*   Analogy might be overly simplistic or forced for complex systems.
*   Requires careful formal definition to be practically useful in a framework like CEREBRUM.
*   Potential for misinterpretation if the analogy is taken too literally.

**Future Directions:**
*   Formalize the mapping: Define precise CEREBRUM constructs corresponding to each case-based interaction.
*   Explore other relevant Hungarian cases (e.g., terminative `-ig` 'up to', causal-final `-ért` 'for') for potential mappings.
*   Develop prototype notation or visualization based on this concept.
*   Investigate mathematical parallels between case semantics and FEP equations governing blanket states.

## 8. Conclusion

The Hungarian surface cases provide a surprisingly apt linguistic metaphor for the tripartite interaction structure (on, onto, from) inherent in the FEP's Markov Blanket. By conceptualizing the blanket as a surface, the Superessive, Sublative, and Delative cases offer a structured way to think about and potentially describe the states residing *on* the interface and the information flowing *onto* and *from* it. While speculative, this connection offers a novel perspective for understanding and modeling system boundaries and interactions, potentially enriching frameworks like CEREBRUM designed for total systems modeling.
