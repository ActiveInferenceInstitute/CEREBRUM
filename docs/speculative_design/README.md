## Contents

59 speculative design documents exploring intersections with:

- Affective computing and emotional intelligence
- Agent programming loops
- Biomimetic and swarm intelligence
- Biosemiotics and mycelial networks
- Quantum computing and topology
- Dream state and entheogenic computing
- Musical and ritual computing frameworks
- Cultural and mythic resonance
- And many more experimental concepts...

## Purpose

These documents represent frontier research directions and creative explorations that may inform future CEREBRUM development. They are not part of the core specification but serve as inspiration and theoretical groundwork.

## Status
