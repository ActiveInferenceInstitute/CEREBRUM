# Album: pre-diluvian Super Swadesh

## Tracklist

### 1. Silt Speaks First (Primordial Murmur)

**(Lyrics)**

*Dust motes dance in sunbeam shaft,*
*Water laps on ancient craft.*
*Clay remembers, soft and deep,*
*Secrets that the river keep.*

*Stone tongue tastes the morning air,*
*Wordless plea, a silent prayer.*

> [!NOTE] Sound
> Opens with low, resonant drones mimicking tectonic shifts. Watery field recordings (lapping waves, dripping stalactites) overlay sparse, plucked notes on a heavily reverbed zither or koto. Vocals are hushed whispers, almost chants, gradually incorporating clicks and glottal stops suggestive of an unknown proto-language. Minimal percussion – perhaps the soft thud of clay being worked.

### 2. Obsidian Shards on the Shore

**(Lyrics)**

*Glass-sharp edge where water meets the land,*
*Reflecting skies held in a trembling hand.*
*Before the wave, before the great unmaking,*
*A mirror dark, the future's image taking.*
*Crack! The surface breaks, a thousand points of light,*
*Scattered meanings lost to endless night.*
*Memory cuts, a voluntary bleed,*
*Planting language like a broken seed.*

> [!NOTE] Sound
> Sharp, percussive sounds dominate – struck stones, prepared piano strings hit with mallets, perhaps the sound of breaking glass pitched down. A driving, arrhythmic beat emerges from layered samples of scraping and chipping. A distorted, high-frequency synth melody snakes through the track, sounding like stressed metal. Vocals are more forceful, almost spoken-word, with abrupt cuts and glitches.

### 3. The Cartographer's Dream (Lost Continents)

**(Lyrics)**

*(Instrumental)*

> [!NOTE] Sound
> A purely instrumental piece. Lush, evolving synth pads create vast, atmospheric soundscapes. Melodic fragments played on a haunting flute or duduk drift in and out. Deep, sub-bass frequencies provide an underlying sense of immensity and loss. Occasional sonar pings or distorted radio static hint at failed searches and forgotten geographies. Think Vangelis meets Lustmord mapping Atlantis.

### 4. Whispers from the Ziggurat's Core

**(Lyrics)**

*(Chanted fragments in a constructed proto-language, layered and overlapping)*

*(The chants build in intensity, then abruptly cut off)*

> [!NOTE] Sound
> Dense, polyphonic vocal layers create a disorienting, hypnotic effect. The core sound is human voices, processed with heavy reverb and delay, creating the sense of echoes in a vast, enclosed stone space. Low, ritualistic drumming (frame drums, large bass drums) provides a slow, steady pulse. Minimal harmonic content, focusing on rhythm and the texture of the layered voices.

### 5. Ark Construct (Gopherwood and Pitch)

**(Lyrics)**

*Measure twice, the sky turns grey,*
*Sawdust mixes with the clay.*
*Hammer falls, a steady beat,*
*Against the flood, a slow retreat.*
*Seal the seams, ignore the cries,*
*Reflected fear in watching eyes.*
*Gopherwood groans, a vessel tight,*
*Against the coming, endless night.*
*Gathered pairs, a silent dread,*
*The future walks among the dead.*

> [!NOTE] Sound
> Rhythmic, industrial sounds form the backbone – samples of hammering, sawing, rope stretching, creaking wood. These are arranged into a complex, almost mechanical groove. A simple, repetitive bassline anchors the track. Over this, distorted, anguished vocalizations weave in and out, more cries than singing. The atmosphere is tense and claustrophobic, building towards a crescendo of layered noise.

### 6. Forty Days (Deluge and Dissolution)

**(Lyrics)**

*Rain like needles, sharp and cold,*
*Stories drowned, futures sold.*
*Sky meets earth, a grey embrace,*
*Washing clean this ruined place.*
*(Water sounds intensify)*
*Shapes dissolve, lines disappear,*
*Submerged echoes, muffled fear.*
*The world undone, a liquid sheet,*
*Silence where the voices meet.*
*(Sound fades into white noise/hiss of rain)*

> [!NOTE] Sound
> Begins with the sound of gentle rain, quickly escalating into a torrential downpour. Dense layers of white noise, filtered static, and heavily processed water sounds create an overwhelming wall of sound. Low, sustained synth tones rumble underneath like distant thunder. Any melodic or rhythmic elements from previous tracks are submerged and distorted, occasionally surfacing like debris before being washed away. The track gradually dissolves into static and the sound of receding water.

### 7. Ararat Landing (New Soil, Old Sun)

**(Lyrics)**

*Silence hangs, the water stills,*
*Sunlight breaks on barren hills.*
*Wet earth breathes, a heavy sigh,*
*Underneath an empty sky.*
*First steps taken, soft and slow,*
*Where will roots begin to grow?*
*The echo fades, the word remains,*
*Washed in flood, cleansed by rains.*
*<binary data, 1 bytes><binary data, 1 bytes><binary data, 1 bytes><binary data, 1 bytes>-<binary data, 1 bytes><binary data, 1 bytes><binary data, 1 bytes><binary data, 1 bytes>... <binary data, 1 bytes><binary data, 1 bytes><binary data, 1 bytes><binary data, 1 bytes>... <binary data, 1 bytes><binary data, 1 bytes><binary data, 1 bytes><binary data, 1 bytes>...* (single, clear vocal sounds)

> [!NOTE] Sound
> Opens with near silence, broken by sparse, high-pitched bell tones or chimes. Gradually, a warm, simple drone emerges. Field recordings of birdsong (perhaps distorted slightly) are introduced. A clear, unprocessed human voice hums a simple, hopeful melody. The feeling is sparse, open, and cautiously optimistic, like the first sounds after a long silence. Minimal instrumentation, emphasizing space and clarity. Ends on a single, sustained clear note.
