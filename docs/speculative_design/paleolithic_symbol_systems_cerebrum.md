# Paleolithic Symbol Systems & CEREBRUM

## Introduction: Ancient Cognitive Technologies

Paleolithic Symbol Systems (PSS) represents a novel approach to computational intelligence inspired by the earliest symbolic systems created by human ancestors. By integrating paleolithic cognitive tools with CEREBRUM's case-based reasoning architecture, we create a framework for intelligence that leverages pre-linguistic cognitive technologies developed during humanity's formative cognitive evolution.

This paper explores how ancient symbol systems—cave paintings, notational marks, hand stencils, geometric patterns, and other symbolic technologies from 40,000-10,000 BCE—can inform new approaches to case representation, retrieval, and adaptation. The fundamental insight is that these earliest symbolic systems represent foundational cognitive technologies optimized for the human brain's innate processing capabilities.

## Theoretical Foundations

### Paleolithic Cognitive Technologies

PSS-CEREBRUM draws inspiration from several key paleolithic symbolic innovations:

1. **Notational Systems**: Counting systems and temporal tracking marks as found at Abri Blanchard
2. **Hand Stencil Networks**: Identity and social mapping systems similar to those at Gargas Cave
3. **Therianthropy**: Hybrid human-animal representation systems from sites like Chauvet and Lascaux
4. **Geometric Sign Systems**: Abstract symbol lexicons found across European and African sites
5. **Navigational Mapping**: Spatial representation systems potentially encoded in cave artwork

### Evolutionary Cognitive Kernels

PSS-CEREBRUM implements computational structures based on evolutionarily ancient cognitive modules:

1. **Pareidolia Engines**: Pattern-detection systems optimized for identifying meaningful forms
2. **Sympathetic Reasoning**: Inference through emulated causality and representational magic
3. **Social Cognition Networks**: Theory of mind structures for agent modeling
4. **Animistic Attribution**: Intentionality detection systems applied to non-agent phenomena
5. **Narrative Sequence Trackers**: Event-sequence encoding systems

## Architectural Components

### Paleosymbolic Case Encoding

PSS-CEREBRUM encodes cases using paleolithic representational systems:

1. **Iconic Representation**: Direct pictorial representation of case elements
2. **Indexical Signs**: Representations based on causal or material connections
3. **Symbolic Abstractions**: Conventional signs with established meanings
4. **Composite Symbols**: Combinations creating emergent meanings
5. **Contextual Positioning**: Meaning derived from spatial/relational positioning

### Shamanic Interface Systems

PSS-CEREBRUM implements interface systems inspired by shamanic cognitive technologies:

1. **Trance Induction Algorithms**: State-shifting mechanisms to access alternate reasoning modes
2. **Liminal Space Creation**: Construction of intermediate zones between knowledge domains
3. **Therianthropic Transformations**: Perspective-shifting through identity transformation
4. **Animated Cave Systems**: Dynamic knowledge spaces with shifting illumination and perspective
