# Meta Swadesh List Description

## Overview

This document provides context for the `swadesh_list.md` file, which contains a speculative Swadesh list developed for two conceptual "languages": CEREBRUM and FORMICA.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this Swadesh list is **speculative design and conceptual exploration** within the CEREBRUM project context. It is not intended for rigorous linguistic analysis but rather serves as a creative tool to:

1.  **Explore Core Concepts:** Flesh out the thematic differences between the abstract, cognitive focus of CEREBRUM and a potential contrasting system (FORMICA, themed around collective intelligence/biology).
2.  **World-Building:** Provide evocative terminology that might be used metaphorically or conceptually within the CEREBRUM framework or related documentation.
3.  **Stimulate Thought:** Encourage thinking about how fundamental concepts might be represented or perceived differently by different kinds of intelligent systems (one computational/cognitive, one bio-social/collective).

## Methodology

The list is based on the standard 100-item Swadesh list.
The terms for CEREBRUM and FORMICA were **invented** based on the following thematic associations:

*   **CEREBRUM:** Terms were coined to reflect concepts from cognitive science, computer science, information theory, and abstract systems modeling. Examples include `Ego-Node`, `Collective-Graph`, `Query-Timestamp`, `Compute-Load`.
*   **FORMICA:** Terms were coined drawing inspiration from entomology (specifically ants), collective behavior, biology, and natural processes. Examples include `Kin-Self`, `Colony-Weave`, `Nest-Core`, `Pheromone-Trail`, `Hemolymph`.

The terms aim for maximum conceptual accuracy *within their speculative domains* and distinctiveness between the two "languages".

## Usage

This list can be referenced in discussions, documentation, or further speculative design work related to the CEREBRUM project where contrasting fundamental concepts through invented language is useful.
