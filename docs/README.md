# CEREBRUM Documentation

Welcome to the CEREBRUM documentation. This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Case-Enabled Reasoning Engine with Bayesian Representations for Unified Modeling (CEREBRUM) framework.

## Overview

CEREBRUM is a synthetic intelligence framework that integrates linguistic case systems with cognitive scientific principles to describe, design, and deploy generative models in an expressive fashion. By treating models as case-bearing entities that can play multiple contextual roles (like declinable nouns), CEREBRUM establishes a formal linguistic-type calculus for cognitive model use, relationships, and transformations.

## Documentation Structure

This documentation is organized as follows:

- **[Core Specification](cerebrum_core_spec.md)**: Defines the core components, interfaces, and behaviors required for a compliant implementation
- **[Getting Started](getting_started.md)**: A beginner's guide to help new developers start using CEREBRUM
- **[Language Implementations](language_implementations.md)**: Guidelines for implementing CEREBRUM in different programming languages
- **[Model Examples](model_examples.md)**: Examples of CEREBRUM models in various domains
- **[Active Inference Integration](active_inference_integration.md)**: Details on how CEREBRUM integrates with Active Inference principles
- **[Implementation Roadmap](implementation_roadmap.md)**: Phased development plan for implementing the framework

## Core Concepts

CEREBRUM is built around several key concepts:

1. **Case-Bearing Models**: Cognitive models that can assume different functional roles through case transformations
2. **Linguistic Case System**: Using grammatical cases (nominative, accusative, etc.) to represent model relationships
3. **Active Inference Integration**: Applying free energy minimization to drive model transformations
4. **Intelligence Production Workflows**: Structured workflows for intelligence analysis and production

## Standard Cases

CEREBRUM implements eight standard cases that define different functional roles for models:

| Case | Abbreviation | Function |
|------|--------------|----------|
| Nominative | [NOM] | Model as active agent |
| Accusative | [ACC] | Model as object of process |
| Genitive | [GEN] | Model as source/possessor |
| Dative | [DAT] | Model as recipient |
| Instrumental | [INS] | Model as method/tool |
| Locative | [LOC] | Model as context |
| Ablative | [ABL] | Model as origin/cause |
| Vocative | [VOC] | Model as addressable entity |

## Getting Started

To get started with CEREBRUM:

1. Review the [Getting Started Guide](getting_started.md) for a hands-on introduction
2. Explore the [Core Specification](cerebrum_core_spec.md) to understand the framework components
3. Study the [Model Examples](model_examples.md) to see concrete implementations
4. Check the [Language Implementations](language_implementations.md) guide for your preferred language
5. Follow the [Implementation Roadmap](implementation_roadmap.md) for a structured development approach
