# Haskell Language Paradigms and CEREBRUM Mapping

Haskell is a purely functional, statically typed programming language with type inference and lazy evaluation. Its design focuses on expressiveness, safety, and mathematical foundations. This document explores how Haskell's core features map to CEREBRUM's case system.

## 1. Overview of Haskell Paradigms

Haskell is primarily defined by:

- **Pure Functional Programming**: Functions are first-class, have no side effects, and rely on immutable data.
- **Static Typing with Type Inference**: Strong type system checked at compile time, but explicit type signatures are often optional.
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Expressions are not evaluated until their results are needed.
- **Type Classes**: Mechanism for ad-hoc polymorphism, similar to interfaces but more powerful.
- **Monads**: Structure for sequencing computations, especially those with side effects (like IO).

Relationships in Haskell are defined through function application, type constraints, and algebraic data types.

## 2. Mapping CEREBRUM Cases to Haskell Concepts

| CEREBRUM Case | Haskell Equivalent/Analogy | Correspondence Strength | Notes |
|---------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|-------|
| **Nominative [NOM]** | Function being applied; Subject in a pattern match; Value bound in `let`/`where` | Strong | The active entity or the result of a definition. |
| **Accusative [ACC]** | Argument to a function; Data being transformed | Strong | The entity being operated upon. |
| **Dative [DAT]** | Function receiving data (e.g., callback); Target of an action within a Monad | Moderate | Recipient of data or control flow (often implicit). |
| **Genitive [GEN]** | Return value of a function; Field of a record; Parameter of a data constructor | Strong | Represents derived value, source, or component. |
| **Instrumental [INS]** | Higher-order function; Type class constraint; Function used as tool | Strong | Mechanism or constraint enabling an operation. |
| **Ablative [ABL]** | Data source (e.g., list in `map`); Monadic context providing value | Strong | Origin of data or computation sequence. |
| **Locative [LOC]** | Module scope; `let`/`where` clause scope; Type constructor | Strong | Context or container for definitions or values. |
| **Vocative [VOC]** | Direct function application; Pattern matching on a constructor | Strong | Direct invocation or addressing of a function/constructor. |

## 3. Key Haskell Features and Case Relationships

### Pure Functions and Immutability

Function application is central:

```haskell
-- Function definition (INS - tool)
add :: Int -> Int -> Int
add x y = x + y

-- Function application (VOC on add)
-- 5 is ACC (first argument)
-- 3 is ACC (second argument)
-- result is NOM (bound value), also GEN (derived from add)
result :: Int
result = add 5 3

-- Higher-order function (map is INS)
-- (+1) is INS (function tool)
-- [1, 2, 3] is ABL (source list)
-- mappedList is NOM/GEN (derived list)
mappedList :: [Int]
mappedList = map (+1) [1, 2, 3] -- [2, 3, 4]

-- let binding (defines NOM entity within LOC scope)
computeValue :: Int -> Int
computeValue input =
  let intermediate = input * 2 -- intermediate is NOM/GEN
      final = intermediate + 5  -- final is NOM/GEN
  in final -- final is GEN (return value)
```

### Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) and Pattern Matching

ADTs define structures, and pattern matching deconstructs them:

```haskell
-- Define an ADT (Maybe acts as LOC for values)
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
  deriving (Show)

-- Define a record type (Person is LOC for fields)
data Person = Person {
    personName :: String, -- personName is GEN (field accessor)
    personAge  :: Int     -- personAge is GEN (field accessor)
  } deriving (Show)

-- Function using pattern matching (VOC on constructors)
getAge :: Person -> Int
getAge (Person {personAge = age}) = age -- age is GEN (extracted value)

-- Pattern matching on Maybe
-- inputMaybe is ACC (value being matched)
processMaybe :: Maybe Int -> String
processMaybe maybeVal =
  case maybeVal of
    -- VOC on Nothing constructor
    Nothing -> "No value provided"
    -- VOC on Just constructor
    -- x is NOM/GEN (extracted value)
    Just x  -> "Value is: " ++ show x

-- Example usage
-- alice is NOM/GEN (constructed value)
alice :: Person
alice = Person { personName = "Alice", personAge = 30 }

-- Function call (VOC on getAge)
-- alice is ACC (argument)
aliceAge :: Int
aliceAge = getAge alice

-- value1 is NOM/GEN
value1 :: Maybe Int
value1 = Just 42

-- processMaybe called (VOC)
-- value1 is ACC (argument)
message1 :: String
message1 = processMaybe value1 -- "Value is: 42"
```

### Type Classes

Type classes define constraints (INS) on types:

```haskell
-- Type class definition (Eq is INS constraint)
-- class Eq a where
--   (==) :: a -> a -> Bool

-- Function constrained by Eq (INS)
-- Requires type 'a' to have an equality check
areEqual :: Eq a => a -> a -> Bool
areEqual x y = x == y

-- Usage
-- Bool is NOM/GEN (result)
boolResult :: Bool
boolResult = areEqual 5 5 -- True

stringResult :: Bool
stringResult = areEqual "hello" "world" -- False

-- Functor type class (fmap is INS method)
-- class Functor f where
--   fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

-- Using fmap on Maybe (Maybe is ABL source functor)
-- (+10) is INS (function tool)
-- Just 5 is ACC (value being mapped over)
-- resultMaybe is NOM/GEN (derived Maybe value)
resultMaybe :: Maybe Int
resultMaybe = fmap (+10) (Just 5) -- Just 15
```

### Monads (especially IO)

Monads structure sequential computations, often involving context (ABL):

```haskell
import Control.Monad (join)

-- IO Monad example (ABL context)
main :: IO ()
main = do
  -- putStrLn is VOC (direct action)
  -- "Enter your name:" is ACC (data for action)
  putStrLn "Enter your name:"
  
  -- getLine is VOC (action producing value)
  -- name is NOM/GEN (value bound from IO context)
  name <- getLine
  
  -- putStrLn is VOC
  -- ("Hello, " ++ name) is ACC (data for action)
  putStrLn ("Hello, " ++ name)

-- Maybe Monad example
-- divide is INS tool potentially failing
divide :: Double -> Double -> Maybe Double
divide _ 0 = Nothing
divide x y = Just (x / y)

-- Chain computations using Maybe Monad (ABL context)
-- x, y, z are ACC (input values)
-- result is NOM/GEN (final Maybe value)
compute :: Double -> Double -> Double -> Maybe Double
compute x y z = do
  -- intermediate1 is NOM/GEN (bound from Maybe context)
  intermediate1 <- divide x y
  -- intermediate2 is NOM/GEN
  intermediate2 <- divide intermediate1 z
  -- return lifts value into Monad (creates GEN in ABL context)
  return (intermediate2 * 10)

-- Example usage
result1 = compute 10 2 5 -- Just 10.0
result2 = compute 10 0 5 -- Nothing
```

## 4. Implementation Approach

Haskell's strong type system can model cases using ADTs or type classes:

```haskell
-- Case enumeration using ADT
data Case = NOM | ACC | DAT | GEN | INS | ABL | LOC | VOC
  deriving (Show, Eq)

-- Wrapper type with phantom type for case
-- Using DataKinds extension might make this cleaner
data CaseWrapper caseRole a = CaseWrapper { 
    getBaseObject :: a,
    getCase :: Case 
}

-- Smart constructor enforcing case at type level (conceptual)
-- Requires advanced techniques like GADTs or dependent types
-- Simple version just stores the case value:
makeWrapper :: a -> Case -> CaseWrapper Case a
makeWrapper obj c = CaseWrapper obj c

-- Example usage with value-level case checking
sendMessage :: CaseWrapper Case Person -> CaseWrapper Case Message -> IO ()
sendMessage sender message = 
    if getCase sender == NOM && getCase message == ACC then
        putStrLn $ show (getBaseObject sender) ++ " sends " ++ show (getBaseObject message)
    else
        putStrLn "Error: Incorrect case roles!"

-- Domain objects
data Person = Person { personName :: String } deriving Show
data Message = Message { messageContent :: String } deriving Show

-- Create wrappers
sender :: CaseWrapper Case Person
sender = makeWrapper (Person "Alice") NOM

message :: CaseWrapper Case Message
message = makeWrapper (Message "Hi there") ACC

-- Call function
-- main = sendMessage sender message
```

## 5. Conclusion

Haskell's functional purity, strong typing, and lazy evaluation provide distinct mappings to CEREBRUM cases:

- Function application and return values align well with **VOC**, **ACC**, and **GEN**.
- Type classes and higher-order functions clearly represent **INS** (constraints/tools).
- Monads encapsulate context (**ABL**) and sequencing, with `do` notation binding intermediate **NOM/GEN** values.
- Immutability means modification often involves creating new **NOM/GEN** values rather than modifying **ACC** entities in place.

Modeling CEREBRUM explicitly might involve leveraging Haskell's advanced type system features (GADTs, DataKinds, etc.) to enforce case roles at compile time, offering a high degree of safety and correctness.
