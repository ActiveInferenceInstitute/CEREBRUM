# R Language Paradigms and CEREBRUM Mapping

R is a language and environment primarily designed for statistical computing, data analysis, and graphics. It evolved from the S language and features a mix of functional and object-oriented paradigms, with a strong emphasis on vectorized operations.

## 1. Overview of R Paradigms

- **Vectorized Operations**: Core principle where operations apply element-wise to vectors, matrices, and lists, often implicitly.
- **Functional Programming**: Functions are first-class objects; supports anonymous functions, closures, and higher-order functions (`lapply`, `sapply`, `apply`).
- **Object-Oriented Systems**: Several OO systems coexist (S3, S4, R6), S3 being the most common (uses generic functions and class attributes).
- **Interactive Environment**: Designed for interactive data exploration and analysis.
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Function arguments are often evaluated only when needed.
- **Data Structures**: Rich set of data structures tailored for statistics (vectors, factors, matrices, arrays, lists, data frames).
- **Extensibility**: Massive ecosystem of packages via CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network).

Relationships are defined by function calls, assignment (`<-` or `=`), vectorized operations, formula specifications (e.g., in modeling functions), and object system interactions (method dispatch).

## 2. Mapping CEREBRUM Cases to R Concepts

| CEREBRUM Case | R Equivalent/Analogy | Correspondence Strength | Notes |
|---------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-------|
| **Nominative [NOM]** | Result of function/expression; Variable defined (`var <- ...`); Object returned by function | Strong | Entity resulting from computation or the active object. |
| **Accusative [ACC]** | Function argument (data input); Data frame being modified; Vector element being assigned to | Strong | Entity receiving action, being processed, or modified. |
| **Dative [DAT]** | Variable receiving assignment result (`target <- ...`); Argument receiving output (less common, usually return value) | Strong | Recipient of data or result. |
| **Genitive [GEN]** | Function argument (source); Value on RHS of assignment; Element/Column access (`vec[i]`, `df$col`, `df[["col"]]`); Return value | Strong | Source of data, value, attribute, or component. |
| **Instrumental [INS]** | Function definition; Operator (`+`, `%*%`, `~`); Package providing functions (`library(pkg)`) | Strong | The tool, function, formula, or operator used. |
| **Ablative [ABL]** | Data source vector/list/data frame; Input argument; File connection (`read.csv`) | Strong | Origin of data or iteration stream. |
| **Locative [LOC]** | Environment (global, package, function); List/Data frame container; Function scope | Strong | Context, container, or environment where objects exist. |
| **Vocative [VOC]** | Function call (`func(arg)`); Formula evaluation (`lm(y ~ x)`); Method dispatch (S3/S4/R6) | Strong | Direct invocation, formula application, or function execution. |

## 3. Key R Features and Case Relationships

### Vectors and Vectorized Operations

The fundamental data structure.

```R
# Vector creation (NOM/DAT assignment)
# c() is INS constructor, numbers are GEN sources
x <- c(1, 3, 5, 7)

# Vectorized operation (INS operator `+`)
# x is ABL/GEN source, 10 is GEN source
# y is NOM/DAT result
y <- x + 10

# Print results (VOC call `print`)
# y is ACC/GEN argument
print(y) # Output: [1] 11 13 15 17

# Logical subsetting (INS operator `[`)
# x > 4 is INS condition using GEN sources
# x is ABL source for subsetting
# subset_x is NOM/DAT result
subset_x <- x[x > 4]
print(subset_x) # Output: [1] 5 7

# Assignment to subset (ACC/DAT target)
# 99 is GEN source
x[x == 5] <- 99 
print(x) # Output: [1]  1  3 99  7
```

### Data Frames

Tabular data structure (LOC container).

```R
# Data frame creation (NOM/DAT assignment, LOC container)
# data.frame() is INS constructor
# name, age, score are GEN source vectors
df <- data.frame(
  name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"),
  age = c(25, 30, 28),
  score = c(88, 95, 72)
)

# Accessing column (GEN access using INS `$`/`[[` operator)
# df is LOC container
names_col <- df$name
print(names_col)

# Accessing element (GEN access)
first_age <- df[1, "age"]
print(first_age)

# Adding a new column (ACC/DAT target column)
# df$score / 100 is GEN source expression
df$score_pct <- df$score / 100 

# Modifying data frame (subsetting + assignment - ACC/DAT target)
# df$age > 25 is INS condition
df[df$age > 25, "score_pct"] <- df[df$age > 25, "score_pct"] * 1.1 # Increase score_pct by 10%

# Print modified data frame (VOC print, df is ACC/GEN argument)
print(df)
```

### Functions

Functions are first-class objects (INS tools).

```R
# Function definition (INS tool)
calculate_stats <- function(data_vector) { # data_vector is ACC/GEN argument
  # mean(), sd() are INS functions
  # data_vector is ABL/GEN source for them
  list( # Returns NOM/GEN list
    mean_val = mean(data_vector),
    sd_val = sd(data_vector)
  )
}

# Create data vector (NOM/DAT)
measurements <- c(10.2, 11.5, 9.8, 10.5, 11.1)

# Call function (VOC)
# measurements is ACC/GEN argument
# stats_result is NOM/DAT target
stats_result <- calculate_stats(measurements)

# Access list elements (GEN access using INS `$`/`[[`)
print(paste("Mean:", stats_result$mean_val))
print(paste("SD:", stats_result$sd_val))

# Higher-order function `lapply` (INS tool)
# list_of_vectors is ABL source
# calculate_stats is INS function argument
list_of_vectors <- list(a = 1:5, b = 6:10)
all_stats <- lapply(list_of_vectors, calculate_stats) # all_stats is NOM/DAT result

print(all_stats)
```

*Mermaid Diagram: `lapply` Flow*
```mermaid
graph TD
    InputList[ABL: list_of_vectors] --> Lapply{VOC: lapply(list, func)};
    Func[INS: calculate_stats] --> Lapply;
    subgraph Lapply Iteration
        Lapply -- Element 1 'a' (ACC) --> Call1[VOC: calculate_stats(a)];
        Call1 --> Result1[GEN: list(mean_a, sd_a)];
        Lapply -- Element 2 'b' (ACC) --> Call2[VOC: calculate_stats(b)];
        Call2 --> Result2[GEN: list(mean_b, sd_b)];
    end
    Result1 --> OutputList[NOM/DAT: all_stats];
    Result2 --> OutputList;
```

### Formulas

Formulas define relationships, typically for modeling (INS tools).

```R
# Create sample data frame (NOM/DAT, LOC)
data <- data.frame(x = 1:10, y = 2*(1:10) + rnorm(10, 0, 2))

# Define formula (INS tool)
# Represents relationship y depends on x
model_formula <- y ~ x

# Use formula in linear model function (VOC `lm`)
# `lm` is INS modeling tool
# model_formula is INS specification
# data is ABL source
linear_model <- lm(formula = model_formula, data = data)

# `linear_model` is NOM/DAT result (complex object)

# Print model summary (VOC `summary`, INS tool)
# linear_model is ACC/GEN argument
print(summary(linear_model))

# Extract coefficients (GEN access using INS `coef()`)
coefficients <- coef(linear_model)
print(coefficients)
```

### Plotting

Base R and packages like ggplot2 provide plotting functions (INS tools).

```R
# Base R plot (VOC `plot`, INS tool)
# data$x, data$y are ABL/GEN sources
plot(data$x, data$y, main = "Scatter Plot", xlab = "X Value", ylab = "Y Value")

# Add regression line (VOC `abline`, INS tool)
# linear_model provides GEN coefficients implicitly
abline(linear_model, col = "red")

# Using ggplot2 (requires installation: install.packages("ggplot2"))
# library(ggplot2)
# ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y)) + # VOC ggplot, aes; INS +, geom_point, geom_smooth
#   geom_point() + 
#   geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "blue") + 
#   ggtitle("Scatter Plot with Regression Line")
```

## 4. Implementation Approach

Case roles in R are primarily inferred from:

1.  **Function Signatures**: Argument names often suggest roles (e.g., `data = ...` is often ABL/ACC). Return values are NOM/GEN.
2.  **Assignment Operator (`<-`)**: LHS is DAT, RHS is GEN.
3.  **Vectorized Nature**: Operations implicitly treat vectors/columns as ABL sources and produce NOM results or modify ACC targets.
4.  **Formulas (`~`)**: Define relationships (INS) between variables (GEN sources within a data LOC).
5.  **Subsetting Operators (`[`, `[[`, `$`)**: Access GEN components from LOC containers.
6.  **OO Systems**: Method dispatch (VOC) acts on objects (NOM/ACC).

Explicit CEREBRUM modeling isn't idiomatic. Documentation (comments, function help files) clarifies intent.

## 5. Conclusion

R's design for data analysis provides natural mappings to CEREBRUM cases:

- Vectors, data frames, lists serve as **ABL** sources and **LOC** containers.
- Function calls (**VOC**) apply **INS** tools (functions, operators) to **ACC**/**GEN** arguments.
- Assignment (`<-`) clearly marks **DAT** recipients and **GEN** sources.
- Vectorization implies implicit iteration over **ABL** sources.
- Formulas (`~`) are explicit **INS** representations of relationships between **GEN** variables.
- Subsetting provides **GEN** access to components within **LOC** structures.

While R's flexibility and multiple OO systems can sometimes lead to ambiguity, its focus on applying functions to data structures aligns well with interpreting operations through the lens of case relationships.
