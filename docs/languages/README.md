# Language-Specific Case Mappings for CEREBRUM

This directory contains detailed documentation on how CEREBRUM's case system maps to and draws inspiration from various natural languages with rich case systems. Each file provides a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between CEREBRUM's eight standard cases and their counterparts in different languages.

## Purpose

Understanding how CEREBRUM's case system relates to natural language cases serves several important purposes:

1. **Conceptual Grounding**: Provides a foundation in established linguistic concepts
2. **Analogical Reasoning**: Enables understanding of CEREBRUM through familiar linguistic parallels
3. **Cross-Cultural Insight**: Demonstrates how different languages handle similar functional relationships
4. **Extensibility Patterns**: Offers patterns for extending CEREBRUM with additional cases based on linguistic examples

## Languages Included

This directory contains case mapping analyses for the following languages:

- [Latin](latin.md) - Classic Indo-European case system with 6-7 cases
- [Sanskrit](sanskrit.md) - Ancient Indo-Aryan language with 8 cases
- [Russian](russian.md) - Slavic language with 6 cases and rich morphology
- [Finnish](finnish.md) - Finno-Ugric language with 15 cases
- [Hungarian](hungarian.md) - Uralic language with 18 cases
- [Turkish](turkish.md) - Turkic language with agglutinative case system
- [Japanese](japanese.md) - Particles functioning similarly to cases
- [Korean](korean.md) - Agglutinative case marking system
- [Arabic](arabic.md) - Semitic case system with 3 cases
- [Navajo](navajo.md) - Athabaskan language with unique postpositional system
- [Basque](basque.md) - Language isolate with ergative-absolutive alignment
- [Georgian](georgian.md) - Kartvelian language with complex case system
- [German](german.md) - Germanic language with 4 cases

## Structure of Each Language Document

Each language document follows a consistent structure:

1. **Overview of the Language's Case System** - Brief introduction to the language and its approach to cases
2. **Case Inventory** - Comprehensive list of cases in the language with their functions
3. **Mapping to CEREBRUM Cases** - Detailed mapping between CEREBRUM and the language's cases
4. **Unique Features** - Distinctive aspects of the language's case system relevant to CEREBRUM
5. **Extension Opportunities** - Potential extensions to CEREBRUM inspired by the language
6. **Example Sentences** - Practical examples showing case usage in both domains

## Usage Guide

These language mappings can be used in several ways:

1. **Conceptual Understanding** - Better grasp CEREBRUM's case system through linguistic parallels
2. **Explaining to Linguists** - Use familiar concepts to introduce CEREBRUM to linguistics professionals
3. **Extended Case Design** - Draw inspiration for custom cases in CEREBRUM implementations
4. **Cross-Cultural Adaptation** - Adapt CEREBRUM concepts to different linguistic traditions
