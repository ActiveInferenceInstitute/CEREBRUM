# Language-Specific Case Mappings for CEREBRUM

This directory contains detailed documentation on how CEREBRUM's case system maps to and draws inspiration from various natural languages with rich case systems. Each file provides a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between CEREBRUM's eight standard cases and their counterparts in different languages.

## Purpose

Understanding how CEREBRUM's case system relates to natural language cases serves several important purposes:

1. **Conceptual Grounding**: Provides a foundation in established linguistic concepts
2. **Analogical Reasoning**: Enables understanding of CEREBRUM through familiar linguistic parallels
3. **Cross-Cultural Insight**: Demonstrates how different languages handle similar functional relationships
4. **Extensibility Patterns**: Offers patterns for extending CEREBRUM with additional cases based on linguistic examples
