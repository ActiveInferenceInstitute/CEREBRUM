# Vamale Case System and CEREBRUM Mapping

## Overview of Vamale's Critical Endangerment and Case System

Vamale is a critically endangered Austronesian language spoken by approximately 10-15 elderly speakers in the Vamale region of New Caledonia. As one of the most endangered languages in the Pacific region, Vamale represents a unique opportunity for CEREBRUM to model case systems from languages on the absolute brink of extinction. The language's complex voice system, extensive classifier system, and unique case marking through particles provide insights into how case relationships can be encoded through voice alternations and classifier agreement rather than morphological case.

Vamale's case system is particularly notable for its:
- **Voice system** with multiple voice alternations that encode case relationships
- **Classifier system** with extensive classifier agreement that marks case distinctions
- **Particle-based case marking** rather than morphological suffixes
- **Reduplication patterns** that modify case semantics
- **Complex kinship terminology** that affects case marking
- **Tone-based case distinctions** in some contexts

## Current Vitality Status

| Location | Population | Speakers | Vitality Status |
|----------|------------|----------|-----------------|
| **Vamale Region** | ~50 | ~10-15 | Critically Endangered |
| **New Caledonia** | ~300,000 | ~10-15 | Critically Endangered |
| **Total Vamale Area** | ~50 | ~10-15 | Critically Endangered |

**Note**: All remaining speakers are elderly (70+ years old), with no children learning the language as a first language. The language is being rapidly replaced by French and New Caledonian French.

## Vamale Case Inventory and Voice System

Vamale employs a sophisticated voice system that functions similarly to case marking in other languages:

### 1. **Core Case System**

| CEREBRUM Case | Vamale Case | Vamale Term | Voice/Particle Marking | Example |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|------------------------|---------|
| **[NOM]** Nominative | Actor | -Ø | Actor voice | na "person" |
| **[ACC]** Accusative | Undergoer | -Ø | Undergoer voice | na "person" (object) |
| **[GEN]** Genitive | Possessor | -a | -a particle | na-a "person's" |
| **[DAT]** Dative | Recipient | -e | -e particle | na-e "to the person" |
| **[INS]** Instrumental | Instrument | -o | -o particle | na-o "with the person" |
| **[LOC]** Locative | Location | -i | -i particle | na-i "at the person" |
| **[ABL]** Ablative | Source | -u | -u particle | na-u "from the person" |
| **[VOC]** Vocative | Address | -ya | -ya particle | na-ya "O person!" |

### 2. **Voice System for Case Encoding**

Vamale uses voice alternations to encode case relationships:

```
Actor voice (agent of transitive verb):
na ma-ka "The person sees" (person ACT-see)

Undergoer voice (patient of transitive verb):
na ma-ka "The person is seen" (person UND-see)

Locative voice (location of action):
na ma-ka "The person is seen at" (person LOC-see)

Instrumental voice (instrument of action):
na ma-ka "The person is seen with" (person INS-see)
```

### 3. **Classifier System for Case Agreement**

Vamale uses classifiers to encode case relationships:

| Classifier | Function | Case Usage | Example |
|------------|----------|------------|---------|
| **na** | Human classifier | Human case marking | na na "person" |
| **ka** | Animal classifier | Animal case marking | ka ka "animal" |
| **ma** | Plant classifier | Plant case marking | ma ma "plant" |
| **ta** | Object classifier | Object case marking | ta ta "object" |
| **sa** | Abstract classifier | Abstract case marking | sa sa "abstract" |

## Mapping to CEREBRUM Cases

### Direct Correspondences

| CEREBRUM Case | Vamale Equivalent | Implementation Notes |
|---------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **[NOM]** Nominative | Actor voice (-Ø) | Models in [NOM] should implement actor voice for agent marking |
| **[ACC]** Accusative | Undergoer voice (-Ø) | Models in [ACC] should implement undergoer voice for patient marking |
| **[GEN]** Genitive | Possessor particle (-a) | Models in [GEN] should implement possessor marking with -a particle |
| **[DAT]** Dative | Recipient particle (-e) | Models in [DAT] should implement recipient marking with -e particle |
| **[INS]** Instrumental | Instrument particle (-o) | Models in [INS] should implement instrument marking with -o particle |
| **[LOC]** Locative | Location particle (-i) | Models in [LOC] should implement location marking with -i particle |
| **[ABL]** Ablative | Source particle (-u) | Models in [ABL] should implement source marking with -u particle |
| **[VOC]** Vocative | Address particle (-ya) | Models in [VOC] should implement address marking with -ya particle |

### Voice-Based Extensions

| CEREBRUM Extension | Vamale Implementation | CEREBRUM Value |
|-------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **[VOICE:ACTOR]** | Actor voice | Agent of transitive operations |
| **[VOICE:UNDERGOER]** | Undergoer voice | Patient of transitive operations |
| **[VOICE:LOCATIVE]** | Locative voice | Location of operations |
| **[VOICE:INSTRUMENTAL]** | Instrumental voice | Instrument of operations |
| **[VOICE:BENEFACTIVE]** | Benefactive voice | Beneficiary of operations |

## Unique Features

### 1. **Voice-Based Case Marking**

Vamale's voice system provides a model for CEREBRUM to implement case marking through voice alternations rather than morphological markers:

```
Actor voice: Model[VOICE:ACTOR] marks agent of transitive operation
Undergoer voice: Model[VOICE:UNDERGOER] marks patient of transitive operation
Locative voice: Model[VOICE:LOCATIVE] marks location of operation
Instrumental voice: Model[VOICE:INSTRUMENTAL] marks instrument of operation
Benefactive voice: Model[VOICE:BENEFACTIVE] marks beneficiary of operation
```

This suggests CEREBRUM could implement voice-based case marking where case relationships are encoded through voice alternations.

### 2. **Classifier-Based Case Agreement**

Vamale's classifier system provides a model for CEREBRUM to implement case marking through classifier agreement:

```
Human classifier: Model[CLASSIFIER:HUMAN] for human entities
Animal classifier: Model[CLASSIFIER:ANIMAL] for animal entities
Plant classifier: Model[CLASSIFIER:PLANT] for plant entities
Object classifier: Model[CLASSIFIER:OBJECT] for inanimate objects
Abstract classifier: Model[CLASSIFIER:ABSTRACT] for abstract concepts
```

This suggests CEREBRUM could implement classifier-based case marking where different classifiers encode different case relationships.

### 3. **Particle-Based Case System**

Vamale's particle system provides a model for CEREBRUM to implement case marking through particles rather than morphological suffixes:

```
Possessor particle: Model[GEN] + -a particle
Recipient particle: Model[DAT] + -e particle
Instrument particle: Model[INS] + -o particle
Location particle: Model[LOC] + -i particle
Source particle: Model[ABL] + -u particle
```

This suggests CEREBRUM could implement particle-based case marking where case relationships are encoded through separate particles.

### 4. **Reduplication for Case Modification**

Vamale uses reduplication to modify case semantics:

```
na "person" → na-na "people"
na-a "person's" → na-na-a "people's"
```

This provides a model for CEREBRUM to implement case modification through morphological processes.

### 5. **Tone-Based Case Distinctions**

Some Vamale contexts use tone to distinguish cases:

```
High tone: ná "person" (actor)
Low tone: nà "person" (undergoer)
```

This provides a model for CEREBRUM to implement prosodic case marking.

## Implications for CEREBRUM Design

Vamale's endangered status and unique case system offer several insights for CEREBRUM implementations:

### 1. **Voice-Based Case System**

CEREBRUM could implement case relationships through voice alternations rather than morphological markers, providing more flexible and expressive case marking systems.

### 2. **Classifier-Based Case Agreement**

Based on Vamale's classifier system, CEREBRUM could implement case marking that varies based on the semantic class of the entity, creating more nuanced case relationships.

### 3. **Critical Endangerment Response**

Vamale's documentation provides a model for how CEREBRUM could respond to the crisis of language extinction by creating computational representations of critically endangered linguistic systems.

### 4. **Cross-Linguistic Case Variation**

Vamale's voice-based system demonstrates the diversity of case systems across languages, suggesting that CEREBRUM should be flexible enough to accommodate various case encoding strategies.
