# Korean Case System and CEREBRUM Mapping

Korean (한국어, Hangugeo), often considered a language isolate (though sometimes linked to Altaic or Japonic languages), utilizes a system of particles or postpositions (조사, josa) similar to Japanese, rather than inflectional cases. This document examines how Korean particles correspond to CEREBRUM's computational case framework and how its system offers insights into topic/subject marking and honorifics.

## 1. Overview of Korean Particle System

Korean marks grammatical relationships using particles that attach to the end of nouns, pronouns, and other phrases. Key characteristics include:

- **Agglutinative Morphology**: Particles attach to stems without changing the stem form.
- **Subject/Topic Distinction**: Separate particles for grammatical subject (-i/-ga) and topic/contrastive subject (-eun/-neun).
- **Honorifics**: Particles and verb endings change based on social context and politeness levels.
- **Case Stacking**: Multiple particles can sometimes attach to a single noun phrase.

Korean's particle system, especially its clear subject/topic distinction, provides CEREBRUM with models for differentiating focus, context, and core grammatical roles.

## 2. Korean Particle Inventory (Selection)

### Case Particles (격조사, Gyeok-josa)

| Korean Particle | Romanization | Primary Function | Notes |
|-----------------|--------------|------------------|-------|
| **-이/-가** | -i/-ga | Subject marker | -i after consonant, -ga after vowel |
| **-을/-를** | -eul/-reul | Object marker | -eul after consonant, -reul after vowel |
| **-의** | -ui | Possessive marker (Genitive) | Pronounced [-e] |
| **-에게/-한테** | -ege/-hante | Dative marker (recipient, animate) | -hante more colloquial |
| **-께** | -kke | Dative marker (recipient, honorific) | Used for respected individuals |
| **-에서** | -eseo | Locative (location of action); Ablative (source) | Disambiguated by context/verb |
| **-(으)로** | -(eu)ro | Instrumental (means); Direction | -euro after consonant, -ro after vowel |
| **-와/-과** | -wa/-gwa | Comitative ("and", "with") | -gwa after consonant, -wa after vowel |
| **-보다** | -boda | Comparative marker ("than") | Often follows Nominative |

### Topic/Focus Particles (보조사, Bojo-josa - also called Special Particles)

| Korean Particle | Romanization | Primary Function | Notes |
|-----------------|--------------|------------------|-------|
| **-은/-는** | -eun/-neun | Topic marker; Contrast marker | -eun after consonant, -neun after vowel |
| **-도** | -do | Additive ("also", "too") | Replaces subject/object particles |
| **-만** | -man | Limitation ("only") | Often follows other particles |
| **-까지** | -kkaji | Extent ("until", "up to", "even") | |
| **-부터** | -buteo | Starting point ("from") | Often temporal or sequential |

*(Note: This is not an exhaustive list)*

## 3. Mapping CEREBRUM Cases to Korean Particles

### Direct Correspondences

| CEREBRUM Case | Korean Particle(s) | Correspondence Strength | Notes |
|---------------|--------------------|-------------------------|-------|
| **Nominative [NOM]** | -이/-가 (-i/-ga) | Strong | Marks the grammatical subject |
| **Accusative [ACC]** | -을/-를 (-eul/-reul) | Strong | Marks the direct object |
| **Dative [DAT]** | -에게/-한테 (-ege/-hante), -께 (-kke) | Strong | Marks the recipient; honorific distinction |
| **Genitive [GEN]** | -의 (-ui) | Strong | Marks possession/relation |
| **Instrumental [INS]** | -(으)로 (-(eu)ro) | Strong | Marks means/instrument |
| **Ablative [ABL]** | -에서 (-eseo), -부터 (-buteo) | Moderate | -eseo marks source location; -buteo marks starting point |
| **Locative [LOC]** | -에 (-e), -에서 (-eseo) | Moderate | -e marks static location/time; -eseo marks location of action |
| **Vocative [VOC]** | -아/-야 (-a/-ya) | Moderate | Used for direct address, less formal |

### Topic vs. Subject Distinction

Korean's distinction between the subject marker (-i/-ga) and the topic marker (-eun/-neun) is crucial and offers insights for CEREBRUM's context management:

- **Subject (-i/-ga)**: Marks the grammatical subject, often introducing new information or identifying the specific actor.
  - *Maps conceptually to CEREBRUM NOM, focusing on the agent role.*
- **Topic (-eun/-neun)**: Marks the topic of the sentence (what is being talked about), often indicating known information or contrast.
  - *Maps conceptually to a CEREBRUM mechanism for setting discourse context or focus, potentially interacting with LOC or a dedicated Topic role.*

**Example:**
- *haksaeng-i kongbuhanda* (student-SUBJ studies) - "A/The student studies." (Focus on the student)
- *haksaeng-eun kongbuhanda* (student-TOP studies) - "As for the student, he/she studies." (Topic is the student)

## 4. Technical Implementation: Subject vs. Topic Roles

Korean's system suggests implementing distinct markers or states for grammatical subject versus discourse topic:

```python
class KoreanRoleManager:
    """
    Manages model roles inspired by Korean subject/topic marking.
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.grammatical_subject = None
        self.discourse_topic = None
        
    def set_subject(self, model):
        """ Mark a model as the grammatical subject (like Korean -i/-ga). """
        # Conceptually maps to CEREBRUM NOM
        self.grammatical_subject = model.transform_to_case(Case.NOM)
        print(f"Set Subject (-i/-ga): {self.grammatical_subject}")
        return self.grammatical_subject
        
    def set_topic(self, model):
        """ Mark a model as the discourse topic (like Korean -eun/-neun). """
        # This might involve a specific state or context marker in CEREBRUM,
        # potentially interacting with LOC or a dedicated TOPIC case/state.
        self.discourse_topic = model # Keep original case, mark as topic
        self.discourse_topic.properties["discourse_role"] = "topic"
        print(f"Set Topic (-eun/-neun): {self.discourse_topic}")
        
        # If setting a topic, it often implies the grammatical subject is known
        # or different, so we might clear the explicit subject marker here.
        self.grammatical_subject = None 
        return self.discourse_topic
        
    def get_actor(self):
        """ Determine the primary actor based on subject/topic marking. """
        # If both are set, the topic usually takes precedence in discourse flow,
        # but the grammatical subject is the core agent.
        if self.grammatical_subject:
            return self.grammatical_subject
        elif self.discourse_topic and self.discourse_topic.case == Case.NOM:
            # Topic can sometimes implicitly be the subject
            return self.discourse_topic
        else:
            # Need context or default rules (like Korean zero pronouns)
            print("Warning: Actor ambiguous, relying on context...")
            return None # Or retrieve from wider context
            
    def get_context_frame(self):
        """ Get the current contextual frame (topic). """
        return self.discourse_topic

# Example Usage
student_model = AgentModel("student")
book_model = ContentModel("book")
role_manager = KoreanRoleManager()

# Scenario 1: Focus on student as actor
actor1 = role_manager.set_subject(student_model) # haksaeng-i
context1 = role_manager.get_context_frame()
print(f"Actor: {actor1}, Context: {context1}")

# Scenario 2: Set student as topic
role_manager.set_topic(student_model) # haksaeng-eun
actor2 = role_manager.get_actor()
context2 = role_manager.get_context_frame()
print(f"Actor: {actor2}, Context: {context2}") # Actor might be None or inferred

# Scenario 3: Topic is book, student is subject reading it
role_manager.set_topic(book_model) # chaek-eun
actor3 = role_manager.set_subject(student_model) # haksaeng-i
context3 = role_manager.get_context_frame()
print(f"Actor: {actor3}, Context: {context3}")
```

## 5. Korean Honorifics and CEREBRUM Politeness Levels

Korean grammar incorporates politeness and honorifics extensively, affecting particles (e.g., -ege vs. -kke for Dative), verb endings, and noun choices. This suggests a CEREBRUM mechanism for managing interaction styles:

```python
class PolitenessLevel(Enum):
    PLAIN = "plain" # (e.g., 반말 - banmal)
    POLITE = "polite" # (e.g., 해요체 - haeyo-che)
    FORMAL = "formal" # (e.g., 하십시오체 - hasipsio-che)
    HONORIFIC = "honorific" # Addressee/Referent elevation

class HonorificManager:
    """
    Manages politeness levels affecting transformations and interactions.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, default_level=PolitenessLevel.POLITE):
        self.level = default_level
        
    def set_level(self, level: PolitenessLevel):
        self.level = level
        
    def get_dative_interface(self, model):
        """ Returns the appropriate Dative interface based on politeness. """
        base_dative = model.transform_to_case(Case.DAT)
        
        if self.level == PolitenessLevel.HONORIFIC:
            # Use honorific form (like Korean -kke)
            base_dative.properties["honorific_marker"] = "-kke"
            print(f"Using Honorific Dative (-kke) for {model}")
        else:
            # Use standard form (like Korean -ege/-hante)
            base_dative.properties["honorific_marker"] = "-ege"
            print(f"Using Standard Dative (-ege) for {model}")
            
        return base_dative
        
    def format_interaction(self, interaction_template):
        """ Formats an interaction string based on politeness level. """
        # Simplified example of changing output based on level
        if self.level == PolitenessLevel.FORMAL:
            return interaction_template.format(verb_ending="-seumnida.")
        elif self.level == PolitenessLevel.POLITE:
            return interaction_template.format(verb_ending="-eyo.")
        else:
            return interaction_template.format(verb_ending=".")

# Example Usage
teacher_model = AgentModel("teacher")
student_model = AgentModel("student")

honorific_mgr = HonorificManager()

# Interaction with teacher (use honorifics)
honorific_mgr.set_level(PolitenessLevel.HONORIFIC)
teacher_dat = honorific_mgr.get_dative_interface(teacher_model)
message_to_teacher = honorific_mgr.format_interaction(
    f"Sent data to {teacher_dat}{{verb_ending}}"
)
print(message_to_teacher)

# Interaction with student (use polite)
honorific_mgr.set_level(PolitenessLevel.POLITE)
student_dat = honorific_mgr.get_dative_interface(student_model)
message_to_student = honorific_mgr.format_interaction(
    f"Sent data to {student_dat}{{verb_ending}}"
)
print(message_to_student)
```

## 7. Extension Opportunities Inspired by Korean

1.  **Explicit Topic Management**: Implement a distinct mechanism for managing the discourse topic (-eun/-neun) separate from the grammatical subject (-i/-ga), influencing context and focus.
2.  **Honorific/Politeness System**: Integrate politeness levels that modify transformations (e.g., selecting honorific Dative -kke) and interaction styles.
3.  **Contextual Location Marking**: Differentiate between static location (-e) and location of action (-eseo) within the CEREBRUM LOC case or related mechanisms.
4.  **Particle Stacking Model**: Allow for sequences of functional markers (similar to stacked particles like -eseo-neun) to represent complex relationships.
5.  **Zero Pronoun Handling**: Develop robust context-based resolution for omitted arguments, mirroring Korean's frequent pronoun dropping.

## 8. Conclusion

Korean's particle system, similar to Japanese, offers CEREBRUM valuable insights into marking grammatical functions without inflection. Its most salient contribution is the clear grammatical distinction between subject (-i/-ga) and topic (-eun/-neun), providing a linguistic model for separating core agency (NOM) from discourse context/focus (potentially LOC or a dedicated Topic state).

Furthermore, the pervasive honorific system in Korean grammar suggests integrating politeness or formality levels into CEREBRUM interactions, affecting how models are addressed (e.g., Dative variants) and how communication is framed.

By incorporating these Korean-inspired features, CEREBRUM can enhance its ability to manage discourse context, differentiate actor focus, and adapt interaction styles based on social or operational parameters.
