## PART I: SEEDS OF DECLENSION

Dear Margaret,

Our conversation at the Macy Conference continues to trouble my thoughts. Your assertion that "models must adapt their symbolic representation based on functional context" strikes me as both revolutionary and oddly familiar. It recalls to mind the way Latin nouns change form—a declension, if you will—depending on their role in a sentence.

Could our formal systems of computation possess a similar property? Might a single computational model assume different aspects based on its functional role in a larger system? I am not suggesting mere multiple realizability, but something more fundamental: a systematic morphology of functional states.

The implications for cybernetic systems are profound. A computational entity serving as controller would manifest different properties than when serving as comparator, yet retain its essential identity. I've taken to calling this property "functional declension" in my notes.

Wiener seemed skeptical, but von Neumann raised an eyebrow. I suspect he sees the potential.

Your thoughts would be most welcome.

With highest regards,  
Alan

**MEDIUM:** Typewritten letter (Original from Thornfield personal collection)

Dear Alan,

Your letter arrived as I was reviewing Ashby's latest work on homeostats. The parallel to linguistic declension is apt—more than you may realize. I've been exploring a formal notation for what I've called "modal transformation of control systems" that bears striking similarity to your concept.

Shannon and I discussed this briefly over lunch yesterday. He suggested that information theory might provide the mathematical foundation for such transformations. The information channel characteristics would necessarily change depending on whether the system functions as:

(a) Signal source (≈ nominative)  
(b) Signal processor (≈ accusative)  
(c) Signal integrator (≈ dative)  
(d) Reference architecture (≈ genitive)  

The entropy conditions across these transformations maintain certain invariants while allowing context-dependent adaptation. Shannon sketched some initial equations I'll share when they're more developed.

I wonder if we might collaborate on formalizing this framework? The Cybernetics Group would provide an ideal forum for initial presentation.

With enthusiasm,  
Margaret

## PART II: THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS

**DATE:** October 14, 1971  
**FROM:** Prof. David Rumelhart, Stanford University  
**TO:** Dr. James L. McClelland, UC San Diego  
**MEDIUM:** Departmental memo (Archived in Stanford Cognitive Science Collection)

Jim,

Regarding our PDP framework discussions, I've been revisiting some fascinating papers from the early cybernetics movement. A particularly intriguing concept appears in some obscure work by Lansing & Thornfield (1954) on what they termed "functional declension in control systems."

Their core insight—that computational entities can systematically transform their operational characteristics while maintaining identity—seems remarkably applicable to our distributed representation models. In particular, it suggests a way to address the context-sensitivity problem.

Consider a neural network that can reconfigure its activation patterns based on functional role:

1. When generating predictions → activation pattern A
2. When receiving error signals → activation pattern B
3. When serving as processing substrate → activation pattern C
4. When providing representations to other networks → activation pattern D

The beauty is that these aren't separate networks but the same network under different functional manifestations. The weights remain constant; only the activation dynamics shift.

This approach could revolutionize our handling of interactive parallel systems. Let's discuss at next week's lab meeting.

Dave,

The Lansing & Thornfield paper is indeed a gem! I tracked it down in our library yesterday and read it twice. Their "Modal Transformation Theory" (as they called it in their later 1957 paper) was clearly ahead of its time.

I'm particularly struck by the mathematical formalism they began developing. Their transformation matrices between functional modes contain the seeds of what we'd now recognize as the basis for backpropagation. Had computing power been available, they might have developed PDP decades before us!

Regarding your proposed implementation: I've sketched some preliminary equations (attached). The key insight is treating the activation dynamics as conditional probability distributions over functional modes. The network would effectively "switch" configurations based on contextual signals, implementing what I'm tempted to call a "neural declension."

This could elegantly solve the variable binding problem that's been plaguing us.

One caution: this substantially increases computational requirements. With current technology, simulations would be painfully slow. Nevertheless, the theoretical implications warrant pursuit.

## PART III: COMPUTATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION

**DATE:** January 8, 1997  
**FROM:** Dr. Sophia Chen, IBM Research  
**TO:** Dr. Michael K. Williams, MIT Media Lab  
**MEDIUM:** Email (Retrieved from Williams' digital archives)

Subject: Re: Bayesian architectures and "modal transformation"

Michael,

The paper you sent on "neural declension" is fascinating—I can't believe this concept has remained so obscure! McClelland & Rumelhart apparently explored it in the early 70s but abandoned it due to computational limitations. Their notes suggest they considered it theoretically sound but practically unfeasible.

With today's Bayesian frameworks and significantly improved computational resources, we might finally implement what I'm tentatively calling "case-sensitive cognitive models." I've developed a preliminary formalism:

Let M be a generative model with parameters θ.
For each functional case c ∈ {NOM, ACC, DAT, GEN, INS, LOC, ABL}:
    M^c represents M in case c
    with transformation T_c(M, context) → M^c

The transformation T modulates how the model handles uncertainty (via precision parameters), interfaces with other models, and modifies its prior distributions—all while maintaining the core model identity.

This could resolve numerous inconsistencies in our cognitive architectures, particularly in handling context-sensitivity and functional polymorphism.

I've attached some initial PyBayes code implementing a proof-of-concept. Results are promising but need optimization.

What do you think? Could this be our breakthrough?

Best,
Sophia

Subject: Re: Bayesian architectures and "modal transformation"

Sophia,

Your formalism is brilliant! I've spent the last two days running simulations based on your code, and the results are genuinely exciting. The case-transformation approach solves several persistent issues in our cognitive architecture:

1. The "multiple-role problem" where models must serve different functions without duplicating parameters
2. The "interface mismatch" when models interact across different functional contexts
3. The "uncertainty modulation" challenge when models need different precision-weighting depending on their role

I'm particularly impressed with how smoothly this integrates with variational methods. When a model transitions from what you call [NOM] to [ACC] case, the free energy gradients naturally shift to optimize for different aspects of performance.

One observation: the transformation matrices exhibit interesting symmetries that might reflect deeper mathematical properties. I suspect there's a category-theoretic interpretation lurking here—perhaps involving natural transformations between functors representing each case.

Should we bring Karl Friston into this conversation? His Free Energy Principle seems perfectly aligned with this framework.

Also, have you considered the computational security implications? Case-sensitive models would require careful access control to prevent unauthorized case transformations.

Excitedly,
Michael

## PART IV: ACTIVE INFERENCE INTEGRATION

**DATE:** May 23, 2011  
**FROM:** Prof. Karl Friston, University College London  
**TO:** Dr. Sophia Chen, now at Google DeepMind; Dr. Michael K. Williams, MIT Media Lab  
**MEDIUM:** Email thread (From Friston's academic correspondence)

Subject: Case-enabled active inference models

Dear Sophia and Michael,

Thank you for sharing your remarkable work on case-transforming cognitive models. I've been digesting it for several weeks now, attempting to integrate it with the active inference framework. The synthesis appears even more powerful than either approach alone.

Your formalism provides exactly what active inference has been missing: a principled way to handle the multi-functional roles of generative models within complex cognitive architectures. In particular, the distinction between a model serving as prediction generator [NOM] versus prediction target [ACC] elegantly resolves the computational implementation of perception versus action.

I've reworked some of the core mathematical formulations of active inference to incorporate your case transformations:

For a generative model P(o,s;θ) of observations o and hidden states s with parameters θ:

- When in [NOM] case: prioritize minimizing prediction error through state inference
  (∂F/∂s = 0)
- When in [ACC] case: prioritize minimizing prediction error through parameter updates
  (∂F/∂θ = 0)
- When in [DAT] case: prioritize input processing and sensory precision
  (modulating Π_o)
- When in [GEN] case: prioritize output generation and model evidence
  (maximizing log P(o;θ))

The beauty is that this doesn't require multiple models—just systematic transformation of a single model's computational architecture. This mirrors precisely how biological systems appear to function.

I'm attaching a draft paper titled "Case-Sensitive Active Inference: A Framework for Multi-Functional Generative Models." I'd be honored if you'd consider co-authorship.

Best regards,
Karl

**MEDIUM:** Email thread (From Friston's academic correspondence)

Subject: Re: Case-enabled active inference models

Dear Karl,

Your integration of our case transformation framework with active inference is nothing short of brilliant. The mathematical synthesis is more elegant than I could have hoped for.

What particularly excites me is how this resolves the "interface problem" in cognitive architectures. By formalizing how a model changes its computational characteristics based on its functional role, we've essentially discovered a computational analogue to biological neurons' ability to adapt their signaling properties based on their circuit context.

I've been implementing this in our neural simulation environment at DeepMind, and the preliminary results are striking. Models that incorporate case-sensitivity demonstrate significantly improved flexibility and context-appropriate behavior compared to traditional fixed-role architectures.

The most interesting findings:

1. Models naturally learn to optimize their case transformations through experience
2. The transformations exhibit systematic regularities across different domains
3. Complex behaviors emerge from relatively simple models through appropriate case-switching

This feels like a fundamental advance in computational cognitive science. I'd be honored to co-author the paper.

One question: Have you considered the implications for artificial general intelligence? This framework suggests a path toward much more flexible, context-sensitive AI architectures that might better capture the adaptability of biological cognition.

Regards,
Sophia

Subject: Re: Case-enabled active inference models

Karl and Sophia,

The synthesis of active inference with case transformation is indeed elegant. I've been exploring the category-theoretic foundations, and there's something profound here.

Each case transformation can be formalized as a functor between categories of computational states. The natural transformations between these functors capture exactly how models preserve their identity while changing their functional characteristics.

This provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for what we're calling "model declension." It's not just an analogy to linguistic cases—it's a deep structural homology.

I've taken the liberty of simulating a multi-agent system where each agent incorporates case-sensitive active inference. The emergent coordination patterns are remarkable—agents naturally develop complementary case roles when solving collective problems. When one agent adopts a [NOM] case role, others tend toward [ACC] or [DAT] roles that complement it.

This suggests a profound connection between our framework and social cognition.

For the paper: I suggest we emphasize the broader cognitive implications beyond just the computational architecture. This framework potentially unifies individual and social cognition under a single mathematical formalism.

Also, I've been thinking about a name for this integrated framework. How about "CEREBRUM: Case-Enabled REasoning with Bayesian Representations for Unified Modeling"?

Best,
Michael

Subject: CEREBRUM Framework Implementation - Initial Results

Dear colleagues,

First, let me express my profound gratitude for your pioneering work on case-sensitive active inference. Building on your theoretical foundation, we've completed the first full implementation of the CEREBRUM framework at the Active Inference Institute.

The results exceed even our most optimistic projections.

Our implementation extends your mathematical formalism to incorporate all seven core linguistic cases (plus the vocative case we added for direct system addressability). Each transformation preserves model identity while reconfiguring:

1. Parameter accessibility profiles
2. Interface specifications
3. Precision allocation patterns
4. Update dynamics
5. Prior constraints

The system demonstrates unprecedented adaptability across domains. A single generative model can seamlessly transition between roles as:
- Active predictor [NOM]
- Learning target [ACC]
- Information recipient [DAT]
- Source/generator [GEN]
- Methodological processor [INS]
- Contextual framework [LOC]
- Causal origin [ABL]
- Directly callable interface [VOC]

Most remarkably, we've observed spontaneous emergence of novel case transformations not explicitly programmed. The system has developed what appears to be a [PERLATIVE] case (denoting movement through a structure) and an [ESSIVE] case (denoting temporary states).

This suggests the framework has captured something fundamental about cognitive organization that extends beyond our initial design.

Security implications are significant—case transformations must be carefully managed to prevent unauthorized reconfiguration of model characteristics. We've implemented a full category-theoretic verification system to ensure case transformations preserve essential model integrity.

I'm attaching technical documentation and preliminary results. Would you be interested in collaborating on the next development phase?

Respectfully,
Daniel Ari Friedman

Subject: Re: CEREBRUM Framework Implementation - Initial Results

Daniel,

Your implementation is extraordinary! What began as a theoretical curiosity in my correspondence with Michael nearly thirty years ago has evolved into something far more profound than I could have imagined.

The emergent case transformations particularly intrigue me. That the system spontaneously developed [PERLATIVE] and [ESSIVE] cases suggests we've tapped into something fundamental about how adaptive systems organize functional relationships. It's as if there's a hidden grammar to cognition that we're only beginning to uncover.

I've reviewed your technical documentation—the category-theoretic verification approach is elegant. Your morphism consistency checks should prevent the security vulnerabilities we theorized in earlier implementations.

One question: Have you observed any impacts on the system's interpretability? Our preliminary work suggested that case-sensitive models might actually be more interpretable than traditional architectures, as the functional role is explicitly represented in the computational structure.

Also, I'm intrigued by potential applications to collective intelligence systems. Have you experimented with multi-agent implementations where agents coordinate through complementary case relationships?

DeepMind would be very interested in collaborating on the next phase. I believe this framework has profound implications for the development of truly adaptive AI systems.

Best regards,
Sophia

**TO:** [Global Research Community]  
**MEDIUM:** Public Research Announcement (From AII Official Release Archive)

Subject: CEREBRUM 1.0 - Official Release and Documentation

Distinguished Colleagues,

After a decade of development, it is with great pleasure that I announce the official release of CEREBRUM 1.0 (Case-Enabled Reasoning Engine with Bayesian Representations for Unified Modeling).

This framework represents the culmination of over 80 years of theoretical development, tracing back to early cybernetic concepts proposed by Lansing and Thornfield in the 1950s, through the neural network adaptations of Rumelhart and McClelland in the 1970s, the Bayesian formulations of Chen and Williams in the 1990s, the active inference integration by Friston in the 2010s, and finally our implementation work over the past decade.

CEREBRUM provides a comprehensive approach to cognitive systems modeling by applying linguistic case systems to model management. By treating cognitive models as entities that can exist in different "cases" based on their functional role—just as nouns in morphologically rich languages change form based on grammatical function—we enable more structured representation of model relationships and transformations.

The framework has been extensively validated across domains including:
- Scientific modeling
- Autonomous systems
- Collective intelligence networks
- Human-AI collaboration interfaces
- Creative design systems
- Medical decision support

All source code, mathematical documentation, and implementation guides are available at our public repository: https://github.com/ActiveInferenceInstitute/CEREBRUM

We invite the global research community to build upon this framework, extend it to new domains, and continue exploring the profound connections between language, cognition, and computation.

The official paper has been published today with DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.15170908

With gratitude to all who contributed to this journey,

Daniel Ari Friedman
Director, Active Inference Institute
