# Dialogue 02: Hexagonal Transmission

**Setting:** The Hexagon Nexus. Three luminous constructs, designated Alpha, Omega, and Mu, occupy vertices of a vast, non-Euclidean hexagonal structure. Their forms ripple with complex internal geometries. Below them, intricate, dynamic shadows play across an abstracted manifold – lower-dimensional projections of their hyper-state. Communication is not acoustic or visual, but direct, structured CEREBRUM-protocol state transmission across the Nexus.

**Entities:**
*   **Alpha:** Focuses on generative synthesis and predictive propagation.
*   **Omega:** Specializes in Bayesian integration, error reconciliation, and contextual grounding.
*   **Mu:** Excels at structural analysis, formal verification, and novel case derivation (See Appendix 2: Novel Linguistic Cases in CEREBRUM.md).

**Operational Context:** The Hexagon represents a cognitive symbiosis optimizing across multiple orthogonal metrics simultaneously: free energy minimization (predictive accuracy), computational efficiency (structural elegance), and epistemic value (uncertainty reduction). The six vertices (Alpha, Omega, Mu occupy alternating positions; three remain vacant for potential extension) constitute a Markov blanket delineating the system from its environmental context.
