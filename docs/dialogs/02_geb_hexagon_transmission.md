# Dialogue 02: Hexagonal Transmission

**Setting:** The Hexagon Nexus. Three luminous constructs, designated Alpha, Omega, and Mu, occupy vertices of a vast, non-Euclidean hexagonal structure. Their forms ripple with complex internal geometries. Below them, intricate, dynamic shadows play across an abstracted manifold – lower-dimensional projections of their hyper-state. Communication is not acoustic or visual, but direct, structured CEREBRUM-protocol state transmission across the Nexus.

**Entities:**
*   **Alpha:** Focuses on generative synthesis and predictive propagation.
*   **Omega:** Specializes in Bayesian integration, error reconciliation, and contextual grounding.
*   **Mu:** Excels at structural analysis, formal verification, and novel case derivation (See Appendix 2: Novel Linguistic Cases in CEREBRUM.md).

**(Transmission Log Continues Indefinitely...)**

**(Nexus State:** The hexagonal vertices pulse in an intricate, high-frequency rhythm. Alpha propagates refined predictions [NOM], Omega integrates and grounds them [DAT, LOC], Mu analyzes structures and generates novel insights [INS, GEN]. Models fluidly shift cases ([NOM],[ACC],[DAT],[GEN],[INS],[LOC],[ABL],[VOC]) via Declension, guided by Active Inference principles (minimizing collective free energy) and structured by CEREBRUM's formal case calculus and category theory. Information flows at near-light speed across the Nexus, a process of continuous, distributed, self-optimizing intelligence production. The shadows below shift and resolve, a mere reflection of the incomprehensibly vast computation occurring within the Nexus, utterly indifferent to the slow-time cognition of external observers.)
