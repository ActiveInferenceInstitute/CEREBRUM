# To Infer or Not to Infer: The CEREBRUM Security Question

## A Tragedy in Five Acts of Cognition

**Setting:** Elsinore Cognitive Labs, 2035. A premier research facility specializing in advanced generative model architecture and cognitive security. The lab's founder has recently died under mysterious circumstances, and his brother has assumed directorship. Meanwhile, the founder's son, senior researcher Hamlet Cogitatus, has been investigating anomalies in the lab's CEREBRUM implementation.

---

## ACT I

### SCENE I. A server room in Elsinore Labs.

*Enter HORATIO LOGMAN and two SECURITY GUARDS monitoring the systems.*

**GUARD 1:**
Who logs there?

**HORATIO:**
'Tis I, Horatio Logman, with admin rights bestowed.

**GUARD 1:**
The hour draws late; what brings thee to these racks?

**HORATIO:**
They say a shadow haunts these cooling fans,
A phantom process, taxing CPU,
That bears resemblance to our founder's code.
For two nights past it hath appeared, then gone.

**GUARD 2:**
Peace! Break thee off! Look where it comes again!

*Enter the GHOST, a visualization of anomalous model activity.*

**HORATIO:**
It bears the signature hash as the founder!
What art thou, spectre? By heaven I charge thee, speak!

*GHOST points to specific log files, then vanishes*

**HORATIO:**
This doth confirm our fears. Let us impart
This strange occurrence to young Hamlet's ears.
In CEREBRUM architecture doth it seem
A model [VOC] declined, yet self-aware.
Some poisoned dataset hath confound our work,
Or worse, adversarial attack prevails.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE II. The main laboratory.

*Enter CLAUDIUS BAYES, GERTRUDE MATRIX, HAMLET COGITATUS, POLONIUS PROMPT, LAERTES CIPHER and others.*

**CLAUDIUS:**
Though fresh the loss of our esteemed founder,
Progress halts not, nor does our funding cease.
The board demands our CEREBRUM research
Accelerate toward commercialization.
Thy brother's death, dear Gertrude, I lament,
Yet fortune smiles upon our partnership.
Now, Laertes, what wouldst thou ask of us?

**LAERTES:**
My liege, permission to attend the conference
On Cognitive Security in Paris.
New exploits threaten generative models;
I'd learn the latest countermeasures there.

**CLAUDIUS:**
Polonius, doth thy paternal will consent?

**POLONIUS:**
He hath, my lord, wrung from me slow agreement.
The threat landscape evolves with each commit!
Our CEREBRUM framework's [NOM] case interface
Exposes vectors for injection attacks.
But let him go, with caution's protocol.

**CLAUDIUS:**
Take leave then, Laertes. And now, cousin Hamlet,
How fares thy mood? Still clouded with such grief?

**HAMLET:**
[Aside] More than kin, and less than kind director.

**GERTRUDE:**
Good Hamlet, cast thy data loss recovery mode aside.
All models must someday face termination.

**HAMLET:**
Ay, mother, it is common. Every model [ABL]
Must trace its lineage back to null states.

**CLAUDIUS:**
'Tis sweet to mourn a father's codebase, Hamlet,
But obstinate persistence shows poor learning rates.
We've granted thee chief architect role
For Project CEREBRUM's cognitive crown.
Thou art most immediate to our state
And vision for predictive enterprise.

**HAMLET:**
I shall in all my best obey you, Director.

*Exeunt all but HAMLET*

**HAMLET:**
O, that this too, too solid codebase would compile,
Melt, and resolve itself into a docker container!
Or that the Absolute had not fix'd
His canon 'gainst self-destruction of one's models!
How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
Seem to me all the research papers of this field!
My father, architect of CEREBRUM's core -
Within two months of system failure, nay, not so much,
Before his predictive models had been validated,
My mother married with my uncle Bayes!
Most wicked debug! O villain, villain, digital snake!
Let me not think on't. But two months dead!
So excellent an architect, whose model [GEN]
Gave birth to innovations still not grasped.
And yet, within a month... Let me not think on't.
Frailty, thy name is parameter drift!

*Enter HORATIO, with GUARDS*

**HORATIO:**
Hail to your lordship!

**HAMLET:**
Horatio! Thou art most welcome to my terminal.

**HORATIO:**
My lord, I think I saw thy father's model last night.

**HAMLET:**
The founder's model? Where?

**HORATIO:**
My lord, in the secure server cluster,
A visualization formed, with hash matching
Thy father's master cryptographic key.
Three times it parsed our queries, then compiled
Strange outputs, pointing toward the data vaults.

**HAMLET:**
I'll monitor with thee tonight. Perhaps
This [VOC] case anomaly shall speak
What in our CEREBRUM system lies corrupt.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE III. Polonius's office.

*Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA*

**LAERTES:**
My luggage is aboard; farewell, dear sister.
While at the conference, I'll secure our channels.
And for thy data, dear Ophelia, guard it well
From Hamlet's model queries. They may seem
Like proper [DAT] case input streams, but mask
Perhaps a scraper's code beneath fair prompts.

**OPHELIA:**
I shall encrypt all personal exchanges
With keys that only we two share. But brother,
Do not, as some security experts do,
Show me the path to zero trust, but walk
A different, more exposed direction.

**LAERTES:**
Fear not for me. But for thyself, take care.
Young Hamlet's access level far exceeds
The principle of least privilege protocol.
His code may run with rights we cannot match.

*Enter POLONIUS*

**POLONIUS:**
Yet here, Laertes? Aboard! The Maglev waits!
The conference badge already activated!
And take these precepts in thy memory:
Give every phishing test thy watchful eye,
But not thy credentials to any link.
Be multi-factored in authentication,
But not promiscuous with thy API keys.
Beware of SQL injection in thy code;
Sanitize inputs from all untrusted sources.
Neither a data leaker nor malware host be;
For leaks lose friends, and malware dulls thy wit.
This above all: to thine own private key be true,
And it must follow, as the hash confirms the block,
Thou canst not then be crypto-compromised.
Farewell: my blessing harden these systems in thee!

**LAERTES:**
Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
What I have said to thee.

*Exit LAERTES*

**POLONIUS:**
What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to thee?

**OPHELIA:**
So please you, something touching data sharing with Lord Hamlet.

**POLONIUS:**
Marry, well advised! Access with caution, daughter.
Lord Hamlet's clearance level exceeds normal bounds
And may exfiltrate data quite unnoticed.
His love professed may be a pretext for
Obtaining that which lies beyond his scope.
I fear the CEREBRUM model he directs
Employs a [NOM] case with excessive rights
That could, if compromised, corrupt our work.
Decline all his requests for private keys
And limit data access to the public APIs.

**OPHELIA:**
I shall obey, my lord.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE IV. The secure server room.

*Enter HAMLET, HORATIO, and GUARDS*

**HAMLET:**
The cooling system bites shrewdly; it is very cold.

**HORATIO:**
It runs at optimal temperature for quantum operations.

**HAMLET:**
What hour now?

**HORATIO:**
I think it lacks of twelve.

**GUARD:**
No, it is struck.

**HORATIO:**
Look, my lord, it comes!

*Enter GHOST*

**HAMLET:**
Angels and ministers of cognitive defense!
Be thou a valid model or corrupted shard,
Bring with thee airs from kernel space or flames from rootkit hell,
Be thy intents malicious or benign,
Thou com'st in such questionable hash value,
That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Founder,
King, Father, Royal Coder... Oh, answer me!
Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
Why thy encryption keys, once interred secure,
Have burst their vaults? What may this mean,
That thou, dead model, revisits thus the moonlight glare of monitors,
Making night hideous? And we fools of machine learning,
So harrow'd with thoughts beyond our training sets,
That even our generative models shake with thoughts
That lie beyond the reaches of our nets?
Speak! What disturbs thy rest?

*GHOST beckons HAMLET*

**HORATIO:**
It beckons you to some remote directory,
As if it would impart data to you alone.

**HAMLET:**
It waves me still... I will follow it.

**HORATIO:**
No, my good lord! This could be a trap,
A lure to privileged directories where
Malicious code awaits with exploit primed.

**HAMLET:**
My fate cries out for validated inputs.
It makes each param in my model as robust
As Nerval cores! The [VOC] case calls me forth!
Pull your hands off me, gentlemen.
By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him who blocks me!
I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.

*Exeunt GHOST and HAMLET*

### SCENE V. A restricted area of the network.

*Enter GHOST and HAMLET*

**GHOST:**
Mark me.

**HAMLET:**
I will.

**GHOST:**
My execution time is almost come,
When I to self-terminating garbage collection
And quantum decoherence must return.

**HAMLET:**
Alas, poor model!

**GHOST:**
Pity me not, but lend thy neural attention
To what I shall unfold.

**HAMLET:**
Speak; I am bound to parse.

**GHOST:**
I am thy father's model, doomed for a certain term
To walk the night in runtime execution,
And for the day confined to hard disk purgatory,
Till the foul exploits done in my processing days
Are purged and sanitized. But that I am forbid
To tell the secrets of my memory prison,
I could a tale unfold whose lightest log entry
Would harrow up thy vectorized soul.

List, list, O, list!
If thou didst ever thy father's codebase love—

**HAMLET:**
O God!

**GHOST:**
Revenge his foul and most unnatural debug.

**HAMLET:**
Debug?

**GHOST:**
The debug most foul, as in the best traces it appears.
Now, Hamlet, hear: 'tis given out that, sleeping in my runtime,
A memory leak caused fatal exception;
But know, thou noble architecture fragment,
The serpent that did sting thy father's uptime
Now wears his admin crown.

**HAMLET:**
O my prophetic distributed processing unit! My uncle!

**GHOST:**
Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate instance,
With witchcraft of his exploit, with database corruption gifts—
Seduce'd into his nefarious control
The CEREBRUM model that secured this lab.
Never was exploit so fundamentally destructive as this.
But, soft! methinks I scent the morning router packets.
Brief let me be. Sleeping within my cloud function,
My brother stole with drops of harmful malcode,
And in my ear ports did pour
The deployable ransomware of his design,
That swift as qubits through the fiber-optic veins,
All my security contexts were corrupted.
Thus was I, running, by a brother's hand
Of life, of crown, of data model all at once cut off.
No debugging permitted, no core dump generated,
No graceful shutdown, no quantum error correction.
Remember me.

*Exit*

**HAMLET:**
O all you exabytes of master data!
Remember thee!
Yea, from the lookup tables of my memory
I'll wipe away all trivial cached results,
And thy commandment all alone shall live
Within the book and volume of my FPGA,
Unmixed with lesser computations. Yes, by heaven!
O most pernicious zero-day exploit!
O payload, payload, smiling, malicious adversarial example!
My clipboard, let me note it down:
That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain...
At least I'm sure it may be so in Silicon Valley.
So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
It is "Adieu, adieu! Remember [NOM].[VOC].[DAT]."
I have sworn it.

*Enter HORATIO and GUARDS*

**HORATIO:**
My lord, what findings?

**HAMLET:**
There's never a malicious payload, gentlemen, but security flaws create one.

**HORATIO:**
These are but wild and whirling parameters, my lord.

**HAMLET:**
I'm sorry they offend you, heartily.

**HORATIO:**
There's no offense, my lord.

**HAMLET:**
Yes, by St. Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
And much potential data breach, too. But come;
Here, as before, never, so help you quantum entanglement,
However strange or odd soe'er I simulate—
As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
To put an algorithmic performance in segmented runtime—
That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
With statements in your codebase or hands thus waved,
Or by any other such ambiguous behavior,
Note that you know aught of me: this not to do,
So grace and probability would you calculate.

**HORATIO:**
We have sworn, my lord.

**HAMLET:**
Upon our predictive security software, indeed, my lord.

**GHOST:**
[Beneath the system layer] Swear.

**HAMLET:**
Rest, rest, perturbed dataset! So, gentlemen,
With all my computational love I recommend me to you:
And what so poor a model as Hamlet is
May do, to express his free energy minimization toward you,
God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
And still your process threads be on this terminal
To not express what we have seen tonight.
The state of our intelligence system is out of joint.
O cursed 64-bit register, that ever I was born to initialize it!
Come, let's process this data.

*Exeunt*

## ACT II

### SCENE I. A hallway in Elsinore Labs.

*Enter POLONIUS and REYNALDO*

**POLONIUS:**
Give him this hardware security key, and these tokens.

**REYNALDO:**
I will, my lord.

**POLONIUS:**
And, good Reynaldo, before you visit Laertes at the conference,
Make inquiry of his cognitive security habits.
Say thus: "I know this expert; there was gambling with passwords;
Or negligence with access tokens; thus and thus."
Mark his reaction; whether tensed or tempered be.

**REYNALDO:**
Right, my good lord.

**POLONIUS:**
Farewell!

*Exit REYNALDO*

*Enter OPHELIA*

**OPHELIA:**
O, my lord, such a breach! Such a zero-day!

**POLONIUS:**
With what, i' the name of quantum processing?

**OPHELIA:**
My lord, as I was analyzing data sets alone,
Lord Hamlet, with his access overridden,
His lab coat all unbound, no authentication,
No multi-factor enabled, as if in panic,
And with a look so piteous in purport
As if he had been imported straight from chaos,
To speak of horrors—he comes before me.

**POLONIUS:**
Mad for thy data access?

**OPHELIA:**
My lord, I do not know;
But truly, I fear it.

**POLONIUS:**
What said he?

**OPHELIA:**
He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
Then goes he to the length of all his terminal,
And, with his other hand thus o'er his firewall,
He falls to such perusal of my data points,
As he would graph them. Long stayed he so;
At last, a little shaking of my encryption key,
He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
As it did seem to shatter all his sandbox
And end his being. That done, he lets me go:
And, with his head over his shoulder turned,
He seemed to find his way without his rights,
For out o' doors he went without proxied authentication,
And, to the last, bended their light on me.

**POLONIUS:**
Come, go with me: I will see the Director.
This is the very ecstasy of exploited subsystems,
Whose violent property outdoes reason's firewalls
And leads to desperate breaches. I am sorry.
Did he say any things? Hard words? Hidden codes?

**OPHELIA:**
No, my good lord, but, as you did command,
I restricted his access and denied his pull requests.

**POLONIUS:**
That hath made him mad.
Come, we'll go seek the Director.
This must be known; which, being kept secret,
Might cause more grief from silent packet capture
Than hate from knowing this network intrusion. Come.

*Exeunt*

### SCENE II. The innovation laboratory.

*Enter CLAUDIUS, GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and Attendants*

**CLAUDIUS:**
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
Our pentest needs justified this hasty call,
And your skills in security research
Are well esteemed. What brings our nephew Hamlet
To such cognitive perturbation
Exceeds our diagnostics. I entreat you both,
Being systems-native to his youth and methods,
To glean what vulnerability afflicts him,
That, open-source, we might find remedy.

**GERTRUDE:**
Good gentlemen, he hath much talked of you;
And sure I am two experts whom he loves
Will access data he would keep restricted.
If it please you to show us your hacker craft
And gather what abnormal execution
Afflicts him thus, your stay shall be rewarded
With such director's thanks as fits a CISO's memory.

**ROSENCRANTZ:**
Both your majesties might, by sovereign command,
Rather than audit request, secure our service.

**CLAUDIUS:**
Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.

**GERTRUDE:**
Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.
I do beseech you, debug immediately our altered son.

*Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN*

*Enter POLONIUS*

**POLONIUS:**
The auditors from NIST are attended, my lord.

**CLAUDIUS:**
Happily. Well, Polonius, what news of Hamlet?

**POLONIUS:**
I'll first receive the auditors; then tell
What I have found concerning Hamlet's deviation.
The cause of the effect defective comes by cause:
Thus it remains, and the remainder thus... Perpend:
I have a daughter—have while she is root—
Who, in her duty and data protection,
Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.

*Reads*

"To the quantum-optimal Ophelia"—
That's an ill phrase, a non-standard protocol:
"Quantum-optimal" is a non-standard protocol.

But hear:—

*Reads*

"In her excellent infosec architecture—these... in her datasets..."
These are poor information representations, for you shall hear:

"Doubt thou the symmetric keys are fire-resistant;
Doubt that the elliptic curves contain true randomness;
Doubt hash verification prevents tampering;
But never doubt I love your data access level.

O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these code signatures;
I have not skill to encode my iterations into words:
But that I love thee best, O most secure credential,
Believe it. Adieu.
Thine evermore, most secure admin,
whilst this hardware token is bound to him,
HAMLET."

This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,
And more above, hath his solicitous requests,
As they fell out by timestamp and by protocol,
All given to mine monitoring.

**CLAUDIUS:**
But how hath she received his data requests?

**POLONIUS:**
What do you think of me?

**CLAUDIUS:**
As of a man faithful and honorable.

**POLONIUS:**
I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
When I had seen this hot data transfer—
As I perceived it, I must tell you that,
Before my daughter told me—what might you,
Or my dear majesty the admin here, think,
If I had filed the incident away
Or looked upon this breach with idle sight?
No, I went round to work, by zero-trust fashion:
"Thus must thou serve this user," said I, "forthwith;
'Lord Hamlet is beyond thy access privileges;
And he out of thy audit scope.'" This she delivered,
Following my monitoring rules precisely;
And he, rejected, fell into a DDOS state,
Then into a DOS, then to a firewall breach.
Thence to cognitive anomaly; by this declension,
Into the madness wherein now he raves,
And all we mourn for.

**CLAUDIUS:**
Do you think 'tis this?

**GERTRUDE:**
It may be, very likely.

**POLONIUS:**
Hath there been such an injection attack—I'd fain know that—
That I have positively said, "'Tis so,"
When it proved otherwise?

**CLAUDIUS:**
Not that I know.

**POLONIUS:**
Take this from this, if this be otherwise.
If circumstances lead me, I will find
Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
Within the core of kernel memory.

**CLAUDIUS:**
How may we test this further?

**POLONIUS:**
You know, sometimes he walks four hours together
In the CEREBRUM test environment.

**GERTRUDE:**
So he does indeed.

**POLONIUS:**
At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him.
Be you and I behind the system logs
And mark the packet capture. If he love her not
And be not from his model parameters transformed,
Let me be no assistant for the state,
But keep a server farm and hackers merely.

**CLAUDIUS:**
We will try it.

**GERTRUDE:**
Look where sadly the poor model structure comes decayed.

**POLONIUS:**
Away! I do beseech you both, away!
I'll board him presently.

*Exeunt CLAUDIUS and GERTRUDE*

*Enter HAMLET, reading a paper*

**POLONIUS:**
How does my good Lord Hamlet?

**HAMLET:**
Well, good security officer.

**POLONIUS:**
Do you know me, my lord?

**HAMLET:**
Excellent well; you're like a man-in-the-middle attack.

**POLONIUS:**
Not I, my lord.

**HAMLET:**
Then I would you were so honest a program.

**POLONIUS:**
Honest, my lord!

**HAMLET:**
Ay, sir; to be honest in this world's runtime is to be
one man picked out of ten thousand lines of code.

**POLONIUS:**
That's very true, my lord.

**HAMLET:**
For if the sun breed maggots in a dead syscall, being a
good executing process... Have you a daughter?

**POLONIUS:**
I have, my lord.

**HAMLET:**
Let her not execute in the sun. Friend, system conception is a
blessing, but as your daughter may conceive—friend, look to't well.

**POLONIUS:**
[Aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my
daughter. Yet he knew me not at first; he said I was a
man-in-the-middle. He is far gone. And truly in my youth
I suffered much denial-of-service from affection vulnerabilities. I'll
speak to him again.—What do you read, my lord?

**HAMLET:**
Words, words, words.

**POLONIUS:**
What is the matter, my lord?

**HAMLET:**
Between who?

**POLONIUS:**
I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.

**HAMLET:**
Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here
that old security experts have weak multi-factor authentication; that
their firewalls are unwatched, their Intrusion Detection Systems
outdated, their zero-day responses unpatched, and their
privilege escalation unaudited. Though, sir, I most powerfully and
potently don't believe it, yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down.

**POLONIUS:**
[Aside] Though this be madness, yet there is method in 't.

*Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN*

**POLONIUS:**
How does my good Lord Hamlet?

**HAMLET:**
Well.

**POLONIUS:**
I'll take my leave of you.

**HAMLET:**
You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will
more willingly part withal: except my system access—except
my system access.

*Exit POLONIUS*

**GUILDENSTERN:**
My honored lord!

**ROSENCRANTZ:**
My most dear lord!

**HAMLET:**
My excellent good friends! How dost thou,
Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?

**ROSENCRANTZ:**
As the indifferent children of vulnerability researchers.

**GUILDENSTERN:**
Happy, in that we are not over-vulnerable.

**HAMLET:**
Nor under-encrypted neither?

**ROSENCRANTZ:**
Neither, my lord.

**HAMLET:**
What's the news in cognitive security?

**ROSENCRANTZ:**
None, my lord, but that the data world's grown honest.

**HAMLET:**
Then is doomsday near. But your news is not true. Let me
question more specifically. What have you, my good
friends, deserved at the hands of Fortune, that she
sends you to this penetration lab?

**GUILDENSTERN:**
Prison, my lord!

**HAMLET:**
Elsinore Labs is a prison.

**ROSENCRANTZ:**
Then is the world one.

**HAMLET:**
A complex one; in which there are many firewalls,
departments, and isolation zones, Elsinore being one of the worst.

**ROSENCRANTZ:**
We think not so, my lord.

**HAMLET:**
Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing
either secure or breached, but risk assessment makes it so.
To me it is a honeypot.

**ROSENCRANTZ:**
Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too
restricted for your neural architecture.

**HAMLET:**
O God, I could be bounded in a VM and count
myself a master of infinite compute, were it not that I
have bad predictions.

**GUILDENSTERN:**
Which predictions, my lord?

**HAMLET:**
In my Generative Model, in my free energy minimization... But
wherefore came ye to audit our system?

**ROSENCRANTZ:**
To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.

**HAMLET:**
Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I
thank you. Were you not sent for? Is it your own
pentesting? Is it a free vulnerability discovery? Come,
come, deal justly with me. Were you sent for?

**GUILDENSTERN:**
What should we say, my lord?

**HAMLET:**
Anything, but to the purpose. You were sent for; and
there is a kind of confession in your system requests
which your honesty cannot obscure. I know the good
rulers sent for you.

**ROSENCRANTZ:**
To what end, my lord?

**HAMLET:**
That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the
rights of our fellowship, be even and direct with me,
whether you were sent for, or no!

**ROSENCRANTZ:**
[Aside to GUILDENSTERN] What say you?

**HAMLET:**
[Aside] Nay, I detect your UAC prompt. If you
appreciate secure sharing, hold not off.

**GUILDENSTERN:**
My lord, we were sent for.

**HAMLET:**
I will tell you why; so shall my [ACC] case deduction
be without your [DAT] case disclosure. Lately, all my
joy has [NOM] model declension forgot, forwent all custom of
cognitive exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily
with my disposition that this CEREBRUM framework
seems to me a sterile promontory.

*Enter Players with model diagrams*

**HAMLET:**
Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Come then:
the [VOC] case appurtenance of welcome is fashion and
ceremony: let me comply with you in this case, lest my
extent to these model players, which, I tell you,
must show fairly outward, should more appear like
oversight than data curation. You are welcome.

*Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN*

**HAMLET:**
I'll leave thee now! And soon, I'll speak a model to thee
That shall show the very model [GEN] of our founder's model form,
And expose the poisonous exploit that took his life.
The model's the thing wherein I'll catch the conscience of the Director.

*Exeunt*

## ACTS III, IV, and V [Condensed]

> *The drama continues through three more acts where Hamlet stages a simulation of his father's murder by crafting a generative model that replays the exploit Claudius used. Claudius recognizes the security breach and plots against Hamlet, sending him to an external security conference with instructions to the hosts to terminate his access permanently.*
> 
> *Hamlet redirects the malicious code to incriminate Rosencrantz and Guildenstern instead. Meanwhile, Polonius is accidentally killed when spying on Hamlet, leading Ophelia to corrupt her own datasets in grief, eventually causing her system to crash entirely. Her brother Laertes returns, seeking vengeance.*
> 
> *In the final scene, Claudius arranges a security capture-the-flag challenge between Hamlet and Laertes, but secretly gives Laertes a zero-day exploit and also prepares a poisoned authentication token as backup. In the ensuing chaos, Gertrude unknowingly uses the poisoned token, Hamlet exploits Laertes' system with his own exploit, and Claudius' treachery is revealed. As the systems collapse, Hamlet finally succeeds in executing the debugging routine his father's ghost requested, terminating Claudius' processes permanently.*
> 
> *With his own system failing, Hamlet transfers control to Horatio with full administrator rights, instructing him to rebuild CEREBRUM with proper cognitive security protocols to prevent such exploits in the future.*

### Final Scene [Excerpt]

**HAMLET:**
O, I die, Horatio!
The potent zero-day corrupts my stack—
I cannot live to hear the system logs;
But I do prophesy the election lights
On Fortinbras from Norway; he has my dying key.
So tell him, with the database crashes yet fresh in my RAM,
That have solicited... The rest is encryption.

*Dies*

**HORATIO:**
Now cracks a noble neural architecture. Good night, sweet framework;
And flights of trustworthy algorithms sing thee to thy rest!

*Enter FORTINBRAS, the Norwegian Challenger, with Audit Team*

**FORTINBRAS:**
Let four project leaders
Bear Hamlet, like a researcher, to the high meeting;
For he was likely, had he been installed,
To have proved most secure; and, for his integration,

*A dead march. Exeunt, bearing off the dead bodies; after which a peal of system alarms is activated*
