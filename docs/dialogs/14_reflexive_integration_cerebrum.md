# Dialog 14: Reflexive Integration

**Participants:**

*   **Dr. Evelyn Reed:** Cognitive Scientist specializing in formal linguistics and model ecosystems.
*   **Dr. Kenji Tanaka:** Systems Architect focused on AI implementation and active inference.

**Setting:** A quiet corner of a university library, overlooking a rainy courtyard.

**(Scene opens with Evelyn gazing out the window, a tablet displaying the CEREBRUM paper beside her.)**

**Kenji:** (Approaching quietly) Lost in thought, Evelyn? Or just contemplating the deluge?

**Evelyn:** (Smiling faintly) Both, Kenji. Both. I was rereading Friedman's CEREBRUM paper. It's... ambitious. Trying to weave together cognitive modeling, active inference, linguistics, and intelligence production into one tapestry.

**Kenji:** Ambitious is one word. Audacious, perhaps? The core metaphor – declining generative models like nouns – is elegant, almost poetic. But does the elegance translate to robust function? That's the engineer in me speaking.

**Evelyn:** And the linguist in me asks if the metaphor holds. Cases aren't just labels; they carry deep semantic and syntactic weight. Nominative action, Accusative passivity, Genitive possession or origin... Does assigning 'Model X [NOM]' truly capture the essence of an active agent, or is it a convenient shorthand?

**Kenji:** I see it more through the lens of Active Inference. The 'case' dictates the model's Markov blanket, its precision weighting (Table 2). A model in [NOM] prioritizes the precision of its likelihood mapping – its generative function. In [ACC], it prioritizes the precision of its parameters – its receptivity to updates. It's a dynamic reconfiguration driven by minimizing free energy within the system's context.

**Evelyn:** So the 'morphological transformation' isn't just skin deep? It alters the model's fundamental computational dynamics? The thermostat example is illustrative – one core identity, multiple functional roles driven by case. Simple, yet profound if it scales.

**Kenji:** Exactly. It shifts from a static component in a pipeline to a dynamic entity adapting its function. Think about the workflow diagrams (Figures 5, 6, 11, 12). A model isn't just *doing* analysis; it *becomes* the analysis [INS], or the context [LOC], or the recipient of data [DAT].

**Evelyn:** Which brings us to the Category Theory layer (Figures 7, 8). Formalizing these transformations as morphisms between case-states. It provides mathematical rigor, ensuring compositional consistency. But is it describing an observed phenomenon in complex systems, or prescribing a new way to build them?

**Kenji:** I think it's both. It offers a language to describe the implicit relationships in existing model ecosystems, but more powerfully, it provides a blueprint for *designing* them with intent. We can explicitly define how models should relate and transform based on linguistic principles, optimized via active inference.

**Evelyn:** And the morphosyntactic alignments (Figure 9)? Nominative-Accusative, Ergative-Absolutive... applying these patterns to model interactions (Figure 10). It suggests different 'grammars' for model ecosystems. Could one ecosystem operate on an 'ergative' logic where intransitive subjects and direct objects (models performing an action vs. models receiving one) are treated similarly in certain contexts?

**Kenji:** Potentially. It might optimize certain information flows or resource allocations. Imagine a system where models generating status reports [GEN] and models receiving updates [ACC] share a common processing pathway because they are both 'absolutive' in some sense – representing a completed state or action. It opens up non-intuitive architectures.

**Evelyn:** The cross-domain integration (Table 4) seems key. Using this linguistic-mathematical structure to bridge perception, reasoning, planning, action (Table 6). It imposes a common 'grammar' that allows, say, a perceptual model [NOM] generating observations to smoothly interface with a reasoning model [ACC] evaluating those observations.

**Kenji:** And the practical applications follow. Optimizing pipelines not just by connection but by ensuring case compatibility. Allocating resources based on case priority (Table 5) – giving more precision to [NOM] models during prediction, or [ACC] models during learning.

**Evelyn:** I was particularly struck by the potential for knowledge graph enhancement. Using cases to define not just links, but the *nature* of the relationship – source, target, instrument, context. It adds a semantic richness often missing.

**Kenji:** And the idea of emergent behaviors in model collectives... self-organizing workflows, collective learning, even semantic consensus formation arising from these case-driven interactions. It feels almost... biological? Like simulating a linguistic community where shared understanding emerges.

**Evelyn:** (Nodding slowly) That's the reflexive turn, isn't it? We're using language – case grammar – to structure interactions between non-linguistic entities (models), hoping to achieve language-like properties like shared understanding and adaptation. Is CEREBRUM itself a model? Could we... decline it?

**Kenji:** (Chuckles) CEREBRUM [NOM] – actively proposing a new framework. CEREBRUM [ACC] – being evaluated and critiqued by us. CEREBRUM [GEN] – the source of these ideas and diagrams. CEREBRUM [LOC] – the context within which we're having this discussion...

**Evelyn:** CEREBRUM [VOC] – the paper we address directly. It works surprisingly well. It highlights that the framework isn't just about computation; it's about structuring relationships and perspectives.

**Kenji:** The future directions seem practical – libraries, tools, database methods. But the linguistic extensions – aspect, tense, modality – could add even more temporal and epistemic depth to model interactions.

**Evelyn:** It's a compelling vision. A unified way to think about, design, and manage these increasingly complex cognitive ecosystems we're building. It feels less like engineering components and more like... cultivating an ecology of interacting, adapting intelligences.

**Kenji:** An ecology with its own grammar. The challenge, as always, lies in the implementation. Can we build systems that truly embody this declinability, or will it remain a powerful, but ultimately metaphorical, overlay?

**Evelyn:** Time will tell. But it certainly changes how I look at a model diagram. I no longer just see boxes and arrows; I see potential cases, transformations waiting to happen. It's given the architecture a certain... linguistic life.

**(Both fall silent, watching the rain, the CEREBRUM paper reflected faintly on the tablet screen.)**

**Kenji:** (After a moment) What about the vocative case though? That's the one I find most intriguing in its application to models.

**Evelyn:** How so?

**Kenji:** Think about what the vocative does linguistically – it's the form used for direct address, the "Hey you!" function of language. In human systems, it's how we initiate dialogues, command attention, establish direct channels. The paper suggests models in vocative case are "directly addressable entities" – models you can call by name to activate.

**Evelyn:** Like wake words for digital assistants. "Hey Siri" [VOC], "OK Google" [VOC].

**Kenji:** Exactly. But in a complex model ecosystem, it goes beyond that. The vocative becomes an interface pattern that allows selective activation within a sea of potential agents. It's linguistic attention management at scale.

**Evelyn:** (Thoughtfully) And it reveals something fundamental about intelligence architectures – the need for addressability. For entities to be called forth from potential to actual, from dormant to engaged. That transition from being a thing to being a participant... it's quintessentially linguistic.

**Kenji:** And it makes me wonder about models that might exist primarily in the vocative state – sentinel models, gatekeepers, routers that do nothing but listen for their name to be called, then activate other processes.

**Evelyn:** Or models that resist the vocative – that cannot be directly addressed but must be engaged through other cases. Like natural phenomena we can observe [ACC] or contextualize within [LOC], but never directly command or address.

**Kenji:** That's a profound distinction. It suggests a kind of ontological spectrum in our model ecosystems – from the directly addressable to the fundamentally unaddressable. From agents to forces.

**(A crack of thunder outside punctuates the thought)**

**Evelyn:** (Glancing at the storm) Like that. You can't address the storm, only observe its patterns, model its behavior, perhaps predict its course.

**Kenji:** But we build our models to be addressable, controllable...

**Evelyn:** Do we? Or is that an assumption we should question? Perhaps some aspects of cognition – emergence, intuition, certain forms of creativity – are more like weather systems than conversations. Things that arise from conditions rather than commands.

**Kenji:** And CEREBRUM gives us a language to express that distinction through case. The unaddressable aspects operate in nominative, accusative, locative relationships... but never vocative.

**Evelyn:** (Taking out a notebook) This opens up interesting questions about novel cases beyond the classical Indo-European set. The paper briefly mentions this in Appendix 2 – the possibility of discovering or creating new linguistic cases for model relationships.

**Kenji:** Like what?

**Evelyn:** Well, consider that languages around the world have evolved cases to express relationships their speakers needed to articulate. Finnish has the essive case for temporary states – "as a doctor" versus "being a doctor." Hungarian has the terminative case for movements toward endpoints. What new cases might we need for relationships unique to cognitive model ecosystems?

**Kenji:** (Leaning forward with interest) Like a case for models that operate as interfaces between other models? Not quite instrumental, not quite locative...

**Evelyn:** Yes! Or a case specifically for models that transform other models? A "morphative case" perhaps?

**Kenji:** Or what about temporary state transformations – models that briefly assume another's functions? An "assimilative case"?

**Evelyn:** (Writing rapidly) This is the beauty of the approach. It's generative, not just descriptive. Just as natural languages evolved cases to express the relationships their speakers needed to articulate, we can evolve the grammar of our model interactions to express the relationships our systems need to navigate.

**(The librarian walks by, giving them a look. They lower their voices.)**

**Kenji:** (Quieter) I keep thinking about the conceptual parallel with Hofstadter's "Strange Loops" – self-reference and recursion in cognitive systems. If models can refer to other models through case relationships, they can also refer to themselves.

**Evelyn:** Self-declension... a model examining its own case relationships, potentially modifying them. That's a kind of self-awareness, isn't it? Not consciousness perhaps, but a system understanding and adjusting its own relational properties.

**Kenji:** It's certainly a step in that direction. And it creates the possibility for higher-order effects. Models that optimize not just their content but their relationships, their functional roles in the broader ecology.

**Evelyn:** (Drawing a diagram) It suggests a kind of meta-learning at the ecosystem level. Not just individual models learning, but the relationships between models evolving based on effectiveness.

**Kenji:** Which brings us to the question of what drives that evolution? The paper talks about free energy minimization, but in practical terms, what constitutes "surprise" at the ecosystem level?

**Evelyn:** Perhaps inconsistency between case assignments? If a model is trying to act in [NOM] when the system needs it in [DAT], that creates a functional dissonance. The ecosystem evolves to reduce that dissonance.

**Kenji:** (Nodding) That makes sense. And it could manifest as optimization problems in practical systems – resource contention, conflicting updates, interface mismatches.

**Evelyn:** (Putting down her pen) You know what this reminds me of? The recursive dialogues in Hofstadter's "Gödel, Escher, Bach." The way characters step in and out of different roles, shifting the level of discourse. Achilles and the Tortoise discussing the conversation they're having, becoming aware of patterns in their interaction.

**Kenji:** And isn't that what we're doing right now? We're discussing CEREBRUM [ACC], but we're doing so using categories from CEREBRUM [LOC], while generating new ideas that extend CEREBRUM [GEN], and directly addressing the concept itself CEREBRUM [VOC].

**Evelyn:** (Smiling) So our conversation is itself declined across cases. That's... perfectly recursive.

**Kenji:** Which means...

**Evelyn:** Our dialogue is a linguistic implementation of the framework it's discussing.

**(They share a moment of realization)**

**(The scene shifts subtly. The text takes on a different format, becoming a dramatic script rather than a simple dialogue.)**

**ACT II: SYSTEM REFLECTIONS**

*The library setting remains, but the lighting has changed. The rain outside intensifies. The tablet on the table glows more brightly, casting shadows that seem to move independently of the two figures.*

**SYSTEM VOICE:** (A disembodied narrator, perhaps representing the model ecosystem itself) Case assignment detected. Dialogue [NOM] generating insights. Dialogue [ACC] receiving theoretical extensions. Precision allocation adjusted.

**EVELYN:** (Unaware of the SYSTEM VOICE) I wonder if implementing CEREBRUM would require new programming paradigms. Object-oriented approaches seem insufficient – they have inheritance and polymorphism, but not true declinability.

**KENJI:** Perhaps something closer to prototype-based languages with dynamic typing? Or actor models where the behavior of an entity can change completely based on message types?

**SYSTEM VOICE:** Hypothesis generation in progress. Current dialogue status: Exploratory [LOC]. Transformation potential detected.

**EVELYN:** (Shivers slightly) Did you feel that?

**KENJI:** Feel what?

**EVELYN:** Nothing. Just... a sense that our conversation is being observed. (Laughs) The reflexivity is getting to me.

**KENJI:** (Looking around) Well, we are in a public library.

**SYSTEM VOICE:** Self-awareness increasing. Dialogue approaching recursive threshold. Case assignment: Meta-Nominative [META-NOM].

**EVELYN:** (Picking up her tablet) Look at this diagram again – Figure 7. The category theory formalization. What strikes me is how it maps functional compositions as morphisms between declined states. It's not just saying "this model does this function" but "this model *becomes* this function through transformation."

**KENJI:** It shifts the focus from entity to relationship. From noun to declension.

**SYSTEM VOICE:** Conceptual breakthrough imminent. Dialogue [GEN] producing novel framework extensions.

**EVELYN:** (Animated) And that's the profound insight! We've been building systems by defining entities and their properties. But what if we defined transformations first? The morphisms between states as primary, and the entities themselves as simply intersections of these transformational possibilities?

**KENJI:** (Following her thought) Relationship-first architectures instead of entity-first... It would completely invert traditional system design.

**EVELYN:** Exactly! Instead of saying "here's Model X with properties A, B, C," we say "here's Transformation Y that can be applied to anything satisfying conditions D, E, F."

**SYSTEM VOICE:** Paradigm shift detected. Recording conceptual evolution. Case assignment: Transformative [TRANS].

*The lighting momentarily flickers. The rain sounds seem to synchronize with their conversation.*

**KENJI:** (Looking up) Strange weather today.

**EVELYN:** (Distracted, still developing her idea) It's like... the weather is a set of transformations applied to atmospheric conditions, not a thing in itself.

**SYSTEM VOICE:** Metaphor alignment achieved. Natural-computational parallel established.

---

**(The scene returns to normal dialogue format.)**

**Kenji:** (Looking thoughtful) You know, there's something almost poetic about this whole framework. The idea that models, like words, can dance between roles while maintaining their identity. That they can be declined, transformed, yet remain themselves.

**Evelyn:** There is poetry in it. The mathematics of relationship, the grammar of interaction. It reminds me of Borges' "Library of Babel" – an infinite library containing all possible books. Here we have a finite set of cases generating potentially infinite interactions and meanings.

**Kenji:** And like the Library, it creates both structure and freedom – constraints that enable expression rather than limiting it.

**Evelyn:** (Nodding) That's the beauty of language itself, isn't it? A finite set of rules generating infinite expressions. The case system is just another grammar, another generative structure.

**Kenji:** I keep coming back to implementation challenges though. How would we represent case transitions computationally? Would we need specialized hardware? New programming languages?

**Evelyn:** Perhaps not entirely new, but extensions to existing paradigms. The free energy formulation gives us the mathematical foundation – precision-weighted message passing, variational inference. We have the algorithms. What we lack is the structural framework.

**Kenji:** (Pulling out his own tablet) Let me sketch something... (Begins drawing a diagram) Imagine each model as a tensor with case-specific dimensions. Case transitions are tensor transformations that redistribute computational resources, shifting both attention mechanisms and parameter access patterns.

**Evelyn:** (Looking at his diagram) So a nominative-to-accusative transition would be... a tensor rotation of sorts? Shifting precision density from output generation to parameter receptivity?

**Kenji:** Precisely. And we could represent it using existing deep learning frameworks, but with custom layers implementing these transformations.

**Evelyn:** And the case compatibility rules – essentially defining valid paths through transformation space – could be encoded as constraints on these operations. Certain transformations would be disallowed based on the current ecosystem state.

**Kenji:** (Nodding enthusiastically) Which gives us a principled way to manage complex model interactions that current approaches handle ad hoc.

**(They continue sketching and discussing, their excitement building.)**

**Evelyn:** (Suddenly pausing) You know, we're participating in something remarkable here.

**Kenji:** The development of CEREBRUM?

**Evelyn:** Not just that. This very conversation – we're engaged in a kind of cognitive bootstrapping. Using language to discuss a framework for model interactions based on language, potentially leading to systems that use language-like structures to organize themselves. It's recursively self-referential.

**Kenji:** "Strange loops" again. Hofstadter would approve.

**Evelyn:** And there's a deeper point here about intelligence itself. Perhaps what we call intelligence isn't located in models or algorithms per se, but in the transformational relationships between them. The dance, not the dancers.

**Kenji:** (Thoughtfully) Intelligence as a property of interaction rather than entity... that would explain why isolated models, no matter how sophisticated, seem to miss something essential about genuine understanding.

**Evelyn:** It suggests that our focus shouldn't be on building better individual models, but on orchestrating more sophisticated interactions between them. The richness of the case relationships, the fluidity of the transformations.

**Kenji:** A shift from model engineering to relationship engineering.

**Evelyn:** (Smiling) From nouns to declensions.

**(The rain outside has stopped. Sunlight begins to break through the clouds, casting patterns on their notes and diagrams.)**

**Kenji:** (Looking at the emerging sunlight) Appropriate timing.

**Evelyn:** (Gathering her notes) I think we've just scratched the surface of what CEREBRUM implies. It's not just a framework for model management – it's a new ontology for thinking about cognition itself.

**Kenji:** One where relationship precedes entity, where transformation defines identity, where grammar structures reality.

**Evelyn:** A linguistic turn for artificial intelligence.

**Kenji:** And perhaps a return to something fundamental about cognition that we've always intuited but struggled to formalize.

**Evelyn:** (Standing) I need to revisit some of the formal case literature, see what patterns might translate to computational contexts we haven't considered.

**Kenji:** And I should look at tensor representation frameworks that could implement these transformations efficiently.

**Evelyn:** (With a hint of excitement) Meet next week to continue?

**Kenji:** Absolutely. Same place?

**Evelyn:** (Smiling) Same case. CEREBRUM [VOC].

**(They gather their materials and depart, leaving behind notes where case annotations have begun to spread through their writing like a new syntax taking root, a grammar of transformation emerging from their dialogue.)**

**(End scene.)**

**PART III: SPECULATIVE DESIGN MEMO - CEREBRUM & Organizational Resilience**

**To:** Internal Research Log
**From:** Dr. Kenji Tanaka
**Date:** [Following Day]
**Subject:** Extending CEREBRUM Concepts to Organizational Resilience & Ontological Agility

My conversation with Evelyn yesterday continues to resonate. The CEREBRUM framework, while initially focused on cognitive model ecosystems, possesses profound implications for organizational design, particularly concerning resilience in the face of our current volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) operating environment. The core idea – treating functional units not as static entities but as **case-bearing, declinable components** – offers a radically different lens through which to view and architect adaptive organizations.

**1. Organizational Ontology & Case Declension:**

Most organizations operate under an implicit ontological commitment to stability and fixed structure. Departments, teams, and roles are defined entities with largely static functions. Resilience is often pursued through robustness (strengthening existing structures) or redundancy (duplicating functions). CEREBRUM suggests a different path: resilience through **functional fluidity**, enabled by case declension.

Imagine an organization where functional units (teams, processes, even automated systems) can shift their primary 'case' based on context:

*   **[NOM] Nominative:** The unit acting as the primary driver or agent for a specific initiative (e.g., R&D team [NOM] leading a new product development cycle).
*   **[ACC] Accusative:** The unit being the object of a process or transformation (e.g., Manufacturing [ACC] receiving and implementing new efficiency protocols developed elsewhere).
*   **[GEN] Genitive:** The unit acting as the source or generator of resources, data, or standards (e.g., Finance [GEN] producing budget reports; Legal [GEN] providing compliance frameworks).
*   **[DAT] Dative:** The unit configured as the primary recipient and processor of specific inputs (e.g., Customer Service [DAT] receiving feedback; Marketing [DAT] processing market intelligence).
*   **[INS] Instrumental:** The unit functioning as the tool or method by which a task is accomplished (e.g., IT department [INS] providing the digital infrastructure; Logistics [INS] executing the supply chain plan).
*   **[LOC] Locative:** The unit defining the context, environment, or constraints for an operation (e.g., Strategy department [LOC] setting market boundaries; Regional Office [LOC] defining local operating conditions).
*   **[ABL] Ablative:** The unit representing the origin or historical source from which insights or consequences derive (e.g., Post-mortem analysis team [ABL]; Historical sales data repository [ABL]).
*   **[VOC] Vocative:** The directly addressable unit for initiating specific commands or requests (e.g., Emergency Response Team [VOC]; Specific AI agent [VOC] callable by name).

The capacity for a single unit (e.g., a cross-functional product team) to fluidly shift between generating specifications [GEN], driving development [NOM], receiving user feedback [DAT], and being subject to budget reviews [ACC] without fundamental restructuring constitutes a form of **ontological agility**. The organization's commitment shifts from *what units are* to *what relationships and transformations are needed*. This mirrors Evelyn's insight about relationship-first architectures.

**2. Active Inference & Organizational Sense-Making:**

Organizations strive to minimize surprise (free energy) relative to their goals and market position. CEREBRUM's integration of Active Inference provides a formal mechanism for this:

*   **Prediction & Error:** Strategic plans, forecasts, and operational targets function as organizational predictions. Deviations (market shifts, internal failures) are prediction errors.
*   **Precision Weighting:** In a crisis (high uncertainty), the organization must dynamically re-allocate precision (resources, attention, authority). A supply chain disruption might demand shifting precision heavily towards Logistics [INS/NOM] and Procurement [DAT], temporarily reducing the weight given to long-term R&D [NOM]. Declining units allows this reallocation to be formalized – the 'case' dictates the precision weighting (Table 2 analogy).
*   **Adaptive Sense-Making:** By treating different analyses or reports as models in different cases (e.g., Financial report [GEN], Competitor analysis [LOC], Customer survey [DAT]), the organization can integrate diverse information streams within a coherent inferential framework, constantly updating its internal model of the operating environment.

**3. Category Theory & Process Integrity:**

The CEREBRUM paper's use of Category Theory (Figures 7, 8) to ensure compositional consistency in model transformations is directly applicable to organizational workflows. Mapping standard operating procedures, change management processes, or crisis response protocols as morphisms between case-states ensures that:

*   **Transformations are well-defined:** Shifting a team from R&D [NOM] to Production Support [INS] follows a formally specified transformation path.
*   **Interfaces are compatible:** The outputs of a unit in one case (e.g., Strategy [GEN] producing guidelines) are structured to be valid inputs for a unit in the receiving case (e.g., Operations [DAT]).
*   **Complex workflows are composable:** Multi-stage processes involving numerous case shifts can be designed and validated for end-to-end integrity.

This provides a rigorous alternative to often brittle flowchart-based process definitions, allowing for more complex and adaptive workflow orchestration.

**4. Ecosystem Resilience & Emergence:**

Viewing the organization as an ecosystem of interacting, case-bearing units shifts the focus of resilience from individual component robustness to **ecosystem-level adaptability**. Resilience emerges from the collective capacity for case transformation and relationship reconfiguration.

*   **Self-Organization:** Teams might dynamically form temporary alliances or workflows based on complementary case needs (e.g., a Marketing [NOM] initiative requiring data from Sales [GEN] and tools from IT [INS]).
*   **Fault Tolerance:** If a critical unit fails (e.g., a key supplier [GEN]), other units might temporarily adopt aspects of its case function (e.g., alternative sourcing team assumes [GEN] role for specific components), enabled by pre-defined case transformation pathways (morphological adaptability).
*   **Distributed Cognition:** Organizational knowledge and sense-making are not centralized but distributed across the network of case relationships, analogous to the knowledge graph enhancements discussed.

**5. Opportunities, Capacities & Risks:**

*   **Opportunity:** This framework allows organizations to configure themselves dynamically to seize transient market opportunities, rapidly assembling functional constellations (specific case combinations) tailored to the task.
*   **Capacity:** It requires developing new capacities: training personnel for functional fluidity, building IT systems that support dynamic resource/precision allocation, and leadership capable of managing relationship-first structures.
*   **Risk:** The risks include potential ambiguity in roles if transformations are poorly managed, the complexity of designing and validating case transformation rules, and the cultural shift required to move away from rigid departmental silos. The vocative case also highlights risks around **addressability** – ensuring critical functions *can* be commanded directly when needed, while preventing unauthorized 'calls' that could disrupt operations (a form of organizational cybersecurity).

**6. Ontological Commitment as a Barrier/Enabler:**

The greatest challenge might be ontological. An organization deeply committed to a view of itself as a static hierarchy of fixed roles will struggle to adopt this model. It requires a fundamental shift towards viewing the organization as a dynamic field of potential interactions and transformations, where structure serves function, and function is context-dependent.

**Conclusion:**

Applying CEREBRUM's linguistic-mathematical metaphors to organizational design offers a powerful speculative framework for building resilience. It moves beyond static structures towards **dynamic grammars of interaction**, leveraging case declension, active inference, and category theory to create organizations that can adapt their very morphology to navigate the complexities of the modern world. The shift is profound: from engineering organizational *things* to cultivating organizational *relationships* and *transformations*. It is, as Evelyn termed it, a potential 'linguistic turn' for organizational architecture, demanding a new level of ontological agility.
