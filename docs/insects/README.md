# Insect Cognition Documentation

This directory contains documentation for CEREBRUM's insect cognition modeling capabilities.

## Contents

- **Assessment Summary**: Overview of insect cognition integration status
- **Entomological Integration**: Deep dive into entomological concepts
- **Implementation Roadmap**: Development plan for insect features
- **Brain Structures**: Insect brain anatomy mapping
- **Cognitive Architectures**: Modeling insect cognitive processes
- **Case Studies**: Specific insect behavior implementations
- **Diagrams**: Visual representations of insect brain structures

## Purpose

CEREBRUM uses insect cognition as a model domain for demonstrating case-based reasoning at scale, drawing parallels between insect neural structures and case transformations.
