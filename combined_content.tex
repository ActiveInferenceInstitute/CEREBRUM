\section{Abstract}\label{abstract}}

This paper introduces Case-Enabled Reasoning Engine with Bayesian
Representations for Unified Modeling (CEREBRUM). CEREBRUM is a synthetic
intelligence framework that integrates linguistic case systems with
cognitive scientific principles to describe, design, and deploy
generative models in an expressive fashion. By treating models as
case-bearing entities that can play multiple contextual roles (e.g.~like
declinable nouns), CEREBRUM establishes a formal linguistic-type
calculus for cognitive model use, relationships, and transformations.
The CEREBRUM framework uses structures from category theory and modeling
techniques related to the Free Energy Principle, in describing and
utilizing models across contexts. CEREBRUM addresses the growing
complexity in computational and cognitive modeling systems
(e.g.~generative, decentralized, agentic intelligences), by providing
structured representations of model ecosystems that align with lexical
ergonomics, scientific principles, and operational processes.

\hypertarget{overview}{%
\section{Overview}\label{overview}}

CEREBRUM implements a comprehensive approach to cognitive systems
modeling by applying linguistic case systems to model management. This
framework treats cognitive models as entities that can exist in
different ``cases'', as in a morphologically rich language, based on
their functional role within an intelligence production workflow. This
enables more structured representation of model relationships and
transformations.

The code to generate this paper, and further open source development
from this 1.0 milestone release, is available at

\hypertarget{cognitive-systems-modeling}{%
\subsection{Cognitive Systems
Modeling}\label{cognitive-systems-modeling}}

Cognitive systems modeling approaches cognition as a complex adaptive
system, where cognitive processes emerge from the dynamic interaction of
multiple components across different scales. This perspective draws from
ecological psychology's emphasis on organism-environment coupling, where
cognitive processes are fundamentally situated in and shaped by their
environmental context. The 4E cognition framework (embodied, embedded,
enacted, and extended) provides a theoretical foundation for
understanding how cognitive systems extend beyond individual agents to
include environmental structures and social interactions. In this view,
cognitive models are not merely internal representations but active
participants in a broader cognitive ecosystem, where they adapt and
evolve through interaction with other models and environmental
constraints. This systems-level perspective is particularly relevant for
intelligence production, where multiple analytical models must
coordinate their activities while maintaining sensitivity to changing
operational contexts and requirements. The complex adaptive systems
approach emphasizes self-organization, emergence, and adaptation,
viewing cognitive processes as distributed across multiple interacting
components that collectively produce intelligent behavior through their
coordinated activity (including language use).

\hypertarget{active-inference}{%
\subsection{Active Inference}\label{active-inference}}

Active Inference is a first-principles account of perception, learning,
and decision-making based on the Free Energy Principle. In this
framework, cognitive systems minimize variational free energy ---
bounded surprise, reflecting the difference between an organism's
internal model and its environment --- through perception (updating
internal models) and action (changing action and ultimately sensory
inputs). The Active Inference framework formalizes uncertainty in terms
of entropy and precision weighting, enabling dynamic adaptive processes.
While many model architectures are possible, hierarchical message
passing is a common implementation that implements predictions as
top-down flows and prediction errors as bottom-up flows, creating a
bidirectional inference system that iteratively minimizes surprise
across model levels. Active Inference treats all cognitive operations as
Bayesian model update, providing a unifying mathematical formalism for
predictive cognition.

\hypertarget{linguistic-case-systems}{%
\subsection{Linguistic Case Systems}\label{linguistic-case-systems}}

Linguistic case systems represent grammatical relationships between
words through morphological marking. Case systems operate as
morphosyntactic interfaces between semantics and syntax, encoding
contextualized relationship types rather than just sequential ordering.
This inherent relationality makes case systems powerful abstractions for
modeling complex dependencies and transformations between conceptual
entities. Cases under consideration here include nominative (subject),
accusative (object), dative (recipient), genitive (possessor),
instrumental (tool), locative (location), and ablative (origin), all
serving different functional roles within sentence structures. Languages
implement these differently: nominative-accusative systems distinguish
subjects from objects, while ergative-absolutive systems group
intransitive subjects with direct objects. While English has largely
lost its morphological case system, the underlying case relationships
still exist and are expressed through word order and prepositions. For
example, in ``The cat chased the mouse,'' the nominative case is marked
by position (subject before verb) rather than morphology, while in ``I
gave him the book,'' the dative case is marked by the preposition ``to''
(implied) and word order. This demonstrates that (the
semantics/semiosis/pragmatics of) case relationships are fundamental to
language structure, even when not overtly marked morphologically
(e.g.~expressed in writing or spoken language).

\hypertarget{intelligence-case-management-systems}{%
\subsection{Intelligence Case Management
Systems}\label{intelligence-case-management-systems}}

Intelligence case management systems organize investigative workflows
and analytical processes in operational contexts. These systems
structure information collection, analysis, evaluation, and
dissemination while tracking provenance and relationships between
intelligence products. Modern implementations increasingly must manage
complex model ecosystems where analytical tools, data sources, and
products interact within organizational workflows. However, current
frameworks lack formal mathematical foundations for representing model
relationships, leading to ad hoc integration approaches that become
unwieldy at scale. As artificial intelligence components proliferate in
these systems, a more rigorous basis for model interaction becomes
essential for maintaining operational coherence and analytical
integrity.

\hypertarget{towards-languages-for-generative-modeling}{%
\section{Towards Languages for Generative
Modeling}\label{towards-languages-for-generative-modeling}}

The Active Inference community has extensively explored numerous
adjectival modifications of the base framework, including Deep,
Affective, Branching-Time, Quantum, Mortal, Structured Inference, among
others. Each adjectival-prefixed variant emphasizes specific
architectural aspects or extensions of the core formalism. Building on
this, CEREBRUM focuses on a wider range of linguistic formalism (e.g.~in
this paper, declensional semantics) rather than adjectival
modifications.

In this first CEREBRUM paper, there is an emphasis on the declensional
aspects of generative models as noun-like entities, separate from
adjectival qualification. This approach aligns with category theoretic
approaches to linguistics, where morphisms between objects formalize
grammatical relationships and transformations. By applying formal case
grammar to generative models, CEREBRUM extends and transposes structured
modeling approaches to ecosystems of shared intelligence, while
preserving the underlying (partitioned, flexible, variational,
composable, interfacial, inter-active, empirical, applicable,
communicable) semantics.

Domains}\label{conceptual-foundations-the-intersection-of-four-domains}}

CEREBRUM integrates four key domains to create a unified framework for

\hypertarget{formal-framework-development}{%
\subsection{Formal Framework
Development}\label{formal-framework-development}}

The CEREBRUM framework was developed as a part of a broader synthetic
intelligence framework, combining linguistic theory, cognitive science,
category theory, and operations research. Key methodological approaches
included:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Linguistic Formalization}: Adapting morphosyntactic case
  theory into computational representations through abstract algebraic
  structures.
\item
  \textbf{Category-Theoretic Mapping}: Implementing category theory to
  formalize morphisms between case states as functorial transformations.
\item
  \textbf{Algorithmic Implementation}: Developing algorithmic
  specifications for case transformations compliant with the Free Energy
  Principle.
\item
  \textbf{Variational Methods}: Applying variational free energy
  calculations to optimize model inference as well as structural
  transformations.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{mathematical-foundation}{%
\subsection{Mathematical Foundation}\label{mathematical-foundation}}

The mathematical foundation of CEREBRUM builds on formalizations of case
transformations using category theory and variational inference. Case
transformations are modeled as morphisms in a category where objects are
models with specific case assignments. The framework employs metrics
including Kullback-Leibler divergence, Fisher information, and Lyapunov
functions to quantify transformation efficacy and system stability. This
approach provides both theoretical guarantees of compositional
consistency and practical optimization methods for computational
implementation.

\section{Core Concept: Cognitive Models as Case-Bearing
Entities}\label{core-concept-cognitive-models-as-case-bearing-entities}}

Just as nouns in morphologically rich languages take different forms
based on their grammatical function, cognitive models in CEREBRUM can
exist in different ``states'' or ``cases'' depending on how they relate
to other models or processes within the system. Figure 2 illustrates
this linguistic parallel.

Within intelligence production systems, these case relationships serve
critical functional roles: nominative models act as primary analytical
engines driving the intelligence case; accusative models become targets
of quality assessment and improvement; multimodal genitive models
generate documentation and reports; dative models receive and process
collected intelligence data; instrumental models provide the
methodological framework for investigations; locative models establish
situational boundaries; ablative models represent the historical origins
of analytical conclusions; and vocative models serve as directly
addressable interfaces for command initiation and documentation
reference. Together, these case relationships create a comprehensive
framework for structured intelligence workflows.

Figure 4 illustrates how this core framework integrates with
intelligence case management.

\section{A Preliminary Example of a Case-Bearing Model: Homeostatic
Thermostat}\label{a-preliminary-example-of-a-case-bearing-model-homeostatic-thermostat}}

Consider a cognitive model of a homeostatic thermostat that perceives
room temperature with a thermometer, and regulates temperature through
connected heating and cooling systems. In nominative case {[}NOM{]}, the
thermostat model actively generates temperature predictions and
dispatches control signals, functioning as the primary agent in the
temperature regulation process. When placed in accusative case
{[}ACC{]}, this same model becomes the object of optimization processes,
with its parameters being updated based on prediction errors between
expected and actual temperature readings. In dative case {[}DAT{]}, the
thermostat model receives environmental temperature data streams and
occupant comfort preferences as inputs. The genitive case {[}GEN{]}
transforms the model into a generator of temperature regulation reports
and system performance analytics (``genitive AI''). When in instrumental
case {[}INS{]}, the thermostat serves as a computational tool
implementing control algorithms for other systems requiring temperature
management. The locative case {[}LOC{]} reconfigures the model to
represent the contextual environment in which temperature regulation
occurs, modeling building thermal properties, or discussing something
within the model as a location. Finally, in ablative case {[}ABL{]}, the
thermostat functions as the origin of historical temperature data and
control decisions, providing causal explanations for current thermal
conditions. This single cognitive model thus assumes dramatically
different functional roles while maintaining its core identity as a
thermostat.

\hypertarget{declinability-of-active-inference-generative-models}{%
\section{Declinability of Active Inference Generative
Models}\label{declinability-of-active-inference-generative-models}}

At the core of CEREBRUM lies the concept of \textbf{declinability} - the
capacity for generative models to assume different morphological and
functional roles through case transformations, mirroring the declension
patterns of nouns in morphologically rich languages. Unlike traditional
approaches where models maintain fixed roles, or variable roles defined
by analytical pipelines, CEREBRUM treats cognitive models as flexible
entities capable of morphological adaptation to different operational
contexts.

Models}\label{morphological-transformation-of-generative-models}}

it experiences orchestrated systematic changes summarized in Table 2:

\hypertarget{active-inference-model-declension-example}{%
\subsection{Active Inference Model Declension
Example}\label{active-inference-model-declension-example}}

Consider a perception-oriented generative model M with parameters theta,
internal states s, and observational distribution p(o\textbar s,theta).
When declined across cases, this single model transforms as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{M{[}NOM{]}}: Actively generates predictions by sampling from
  p(o\textbar s,theta), with all parameters fully accessible
\item
  \textbf{M{[}ACC{]}}: Becomes the target of updates, with parameter
  gradients calculated from prediction errors
\item
  \textbf{M{[}DAT{]}}: Configured to receive data flows, with specific
  input interfaces activated
\item
  \textbf{M{[}GEN{]}}: Optimized to generate outputs, with output
  interfaces prioritized
\item
  \textbf{M{[}INS{]}}: Functions as a computational method, exposing
  algorithmic interfaces
\item
  \textbf{M{[}LOC{]}}: Provides contextual constraints for other models,
  with environmental parameters exposed
\item
  \textbf{M{[}ABL{]}}: Serves as an information source, with historical
  data accessible
\item
  \textbf{M{[}VOC{]}}: Functions as an addressable entity responding to
  direct invocation, with naming parameters activated
\end{itemize}

The Vocative case {[}VOC{]} represents a unique functional role where
models serve as directly addressable entities within a model ecosystem.
Unlike other cases that focus on data processing or transformational
aspects, the vocative case specifically optimizes a model for name-based
recognition and command reception. This has particular relevance in
synthetic intelligence environments where models must be selectively
activated or ``woken up'' through explicit address, similar to how
humans are called by name to gain their attention. The vocative case
maintains specialized interfaces for handling direct commands,
documentation references, and initialization requests. In practical
applications, models in vocative case might serve as conversational
agents awaiting activation, documentation reference points within
technical specifications, or system components that remain dormant until
explicitly addressed. This pattern mimics the linguistic vocative case
where a noun is used in direct address, as in ``Hey Siri'' or ``OK
Google'' activation phrases for digital assistants, creating a natural
bridging pattern between human language interaction and model
orchestration.

This systematic pattern of transformations constitutes a complete
``declension paradigm'' for cognitive models, using precision-modulation
to fulfill diverse functional roles while maintaining their core
identity.

\section{Computational Linguistics, Structural Alignment, and Model
Relationships}\label{computational-linguistics-structural-alignment-and-model-relationships}}

CEREBRUM supports different alignment systems for model relationships,
mirroring linguistic morphosyntactic structures (Figure 9). These
alignment patterns determine how models interact and transform based on
their functional roles. Figure 9 illustrates the core alignment patterns
derived from linguistic theory, showing how models can be organized
based on their case relationships. This includes nominative-accusative
alignment (where models are distinguished by their role as agents or
patients), ergative-absolutive alignment (where models are grouped by
their relationship to actions), and tripartite alignment (where each
case is marked distinctly).

CEREBRUM implements different alignment patterns for model relationships
based on linguistic morphosyntactic structures.}
\end{figure}

Figure 10 demonstrates the practical implementation of these alignment
patterns in model ecosystems, showing how different alignment systems
affect model interactions and transformations. The diagram illustrates
the computational implications of each alignment pattern, including
resource allocation, message passing, and transformation efficiency.
This implementation view complements the theoretical alignment patterns
shown in Figure 9 by demonstrating their practical application in
cognitive model management.

\hypertarget{implementation-in-intelligence-production}{%
\section{Implementation in Intelligence
Production}\label{implementation-in-intelligence-production}}

As mentioned, CEREBRUM integrates with intelligence case management
through structured workflows (see Figures 4 and 6). Figure 11 and Figure
12 provide alternative state-based visualizations of these workflows.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{output/Figure_11.png}
\caption{Implementation in Intelligence Production - State Diagram.

model case assignments at each stage.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{output/Figure_12.png}
\caption{Intelligence Workflow (Alternative View). Presents another
perspective on the intelligence production cycle and feedback loops,
emphasizing case roles.}
\end{figure}

The intelligence production workflow begins with raw data collection,
where models in instrumental case {[}INS{]} serve as data collection
tools, implementing specific methods for information gathering. As data
moves through preprocessing, models transition to nominative case
{[}NOM{]}, taking on active processing roles to clean, normalize, and
prepare the data for analysis. During analysis, models assume locative
case {[}LOC{]}, providing contextual understanding and environmental
parameters that shape the analytical process.

Integration represents a critical transition point where models in
genitive case {[}GEN{]} generate intelligence products by synthesizing
information from multiple sources. These products then undergo
evaluation by models in accusative case {[}ACC{]}, which assess quality
and identify areas for improvement. The refinement phase employs models
in dative case {[}DAT{]} to process feedback and implement necessary
changes, while deployment returns models to nominative case {[}NOM{]}
for active implementation of refined solutions.

This cyclical process demonstrates how case transformations enable
models to maintain their core identity while adapting to different
functional requirements throughout the intelligence production
lifecycle. Each case assignment optimizes specific aspects of model
behavior, from data collection and processing to product generation and
quality assessment, creating a flexible yet structured approach to
intelligence production.

\hypertarget{active-inference-integration}{%
\section{Active Inference

CEREBRUM aligns with active inference frameworks by treating case
transformations as predictive processes within a free energy
minimization framework, as illustrated in Figure 13. Figure 14 details
the associated message passing rules.

\hypertarget{related-work}{%
\section{Related Work}\label{related-work}}

CEREBRUM builds upon several research traditions while offering a novel
synthesis. In this first paper, there are no specific works linked or
cited. Later work will provide more detail in reference and derivation.
The work stands transparently on the shoulders of nestmates and so is
presented initially as a speculative design checkpoint in the
development of certain cognitive modeling practices.

Related approaches include:

\hypertarget{cognitive-architectures}{%
\subsection{Cognitive Architectures}\label{cognitive-architectures}}

Existing cognitive architectures such as ACT-R, Soar, and CLARION
provide comprehensive frameworks for modeling cognitive processes but
lack formal mechanisms for representing functional role transitions.
Unlike these systems, CEREBRUM explicitly models the morphological
transformations of computational entities as they move through different
processing contexts.

\hypertarget{category-theoretic-cognition}{%
\subsection{Category-Theoretic
Cognition}\label{category-theoretic-cognition}}

Recent work applying category theory to cognitive science has
established mathematical foundations for cognitive processes. CEREBRUM
extends this tradition by applying categorical structures specifically
to case relationships and active inference, focusing on practical
applications in intelligence production rather than purely theoretical
constructs.

\hypertarget{active-inference-applications}{%
\subsection{Active Inference
Applications}\label{active-inference-applications}}

Prior applications of active inference to artificial intelligence have
focused primarily on perception and action in individual agents.
CEREBRUM expands this domain by applying active inference principles to
model ecosystems, where multiple models interact within structured
workflows guided by case-based transformations.

\hypertarget{linguistic-computing}{%
\subsection{Linguistic Computing}\label{linguistic-computing}}

Computational linguistics has extensively employed case grammar for
natural language processing, but rarely extended these principles to
model management. CEREBRUM repurposes linguistic case theory as a
structural framework for model relationships rather than textual
analysis.

\hypertarget{practical-applications-of-model-declension-in-cognitive-ecosystems}{%
\section{Practical Applications of Model Declension in Cognitive
Ecosystems}\label{practical-applications-of-model-declension-in-cognitive-ecosystems}}

The declension paradigm for cognitive models offers practical benefits
in complex model ecosystems spanning multiple cognitive domains. This
section outlines specific applications where the morphological
adaptability of models provides significant advantages.

\hypertarget{model-pipeline-optimization}{%
\subsection{Model Pipeline
Optimization}\label{model-pipeline-optimization}}

Complex cognitive workflows typically involve sequences of models
arranged in processing pipelines. Traditional approaches require
specialized interface layers between models, leading to inefficiencies
and compatibility challenges. By applying case declensions to models in
these pipelines, each component can seamlessly adapt its interfaces:

Consider a pipeline where Model₂ exhibits a case transition from
{[}ACC{]} (receiving data) to {[}DAT{]} (forwarding results),
demonstrating how a single model can adapt its functional interfaces
based on its position in the processing sequence.

\hypertarget{computational-resource-optimization}{%
\subsection{Computational Resource
Optimization}\label{computational-resource-optimization}}

In resource-constrained environments, the precision allocation mechanism
provided by case declension enables dynamic distribution of
computational resources:

\end{longtable}

This dynamic resource allocation is formalized through the
precision-weighted free energy equation (Equation 14 in the Mathematical
Appendix), where models are allocated computational resources
proportional to their precision weights for their current case
assignment.

\hypertarget{model-ecosystem-adaptability}{%
\subsection{Model Ecosystem
Adaptability}\label{model-ecosystem-adaptability}}

Cognitive ecosystems must adapt to changing environments and
requirements. The declension paradigm enables flexible reconfiguration
of model relationships without architectural redesign.

Conceptually, this means the same set of models can reconfigure their
functional roles through case reassignment, adapting to new requirements
without changing the underlying model implementations.

\hypertarget{knowledge-graph-enhancement}{%

Enhancement}\label{knowledge-graph-enhancement}}

The case declension system enhances knowledge representation by
providing richer relational semantics in model-based knowledge graphs.
This enhancement operates at multiple levels:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Semantic Role Labeling}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Models in {[}NOM{]} case represent active knowledge producers
  \item
    Models in {[}ACC{]} case represent knowledge targets/recipients
  \item
    Models in {[}DAT{]} case represent knowledge transfer endpoints
  \item
    Models in {[}GEN{]} case represent knowledge sources/origins
  \item
    Models in {[}INS{]} case represent methodological knowledge
  \item
    Models in {[}LOC{]} case represent contextual knowledge
  \item
    Models in {[}ABL{]} case represent historical/causal knowledge
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Relationship Typing}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Morphosyntactic edges encode relationship types
  \item
    Case assignments provide edge directionality
  \item
    Case transitions represent knowledge flow patterns
  \item
    Multi-case paths represent complex knowledge transformations
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Example Knowledge Propagation Rules}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Case-preserving transformations maintain semantic roles
  \item
    Case-changing transformations represent functional shifts
  \item
    Case alignment patterns guide knowledge integration
  \item
    Case-based precision weighting prioritizes knowledge flow (see
    Equation 13 in Mathematical Appendix)
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

This enhanced knowledge graph shows how case-declined models provide
explicit relationship semantics between entities, creating richer
knowledge representations that mirror the way natural language encodes
semantic relationships through case systems.

\hypertarget{emergent-behaviors-in-model-collectives}{%
\subsection{Emergent Behaviors in Model
Collectives}\label{emergent-behaviors-in-model-collectives}}

When multiple case-bearing models interact within an ecosystem, emergent

\item
  \textbf{Adaptive resource allocation}:

  \item
    Precision-weighted competition for computational resources drives
    efficient task distribution
  \item
    Similar to attention allocation in linguistic communities
  \item
    Resources are allocated based on case-specific precision weights
    (see Equation 13 in the Mathematical Appendix)
  \item
    Dynamic reallocation follows free energy gradients
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Collective learning}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Error signals propagate through case relationships
  \item
    Like linguistic communities converging on shared meanings
  \item
    Learning rates are modulated by case compatibility
  \item
    System-wide adaptation through message passing (see Equations 8-12
    in the Mathematical Appendix)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Fault tolerance}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Models can adopt alternative cases when certain cognitive functions
    are degraded
  \item
    Similar to linguistic communities adapting to speaker limitations
  \item
    Case reassignment follows free energy minimization
  \item
    Graceful degradation through case flexibility
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Semantic Consensus Formation}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Models converge on shared representations through case-mediated
    interactions
  \item
    Parallels linguistic communities developing shared vocabularies
  \item
    Consensus emerges through case-specific alignment
  \item
    Alignment strength varies by case type
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Hierarchical Organization}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Case relationships naturally create processing hierarchies
  \item
    Like linguistic communities developing formal/informal speech levels
  \item
    Hierarchy levels emerge from case distributions
  \item
    Case assignments reflect hierarchical position
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

These emergent properties demonstrate how the declension paradigm
enables robust, adaptive collective behaviors in complex cognitive
ecosystems, mirroring the way linguistic communities develop and
maintain shared understanding through structured interactions. The
mathematical formalization of these properties provides a rigorous
foundation for analyzing and optimizing model collective behavior.

The parallel between model collectives and linguistic communities
extends to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Information Flow Patterns}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Case-based routing: Messages flow according to case compatibility
  \item
    Community structure: Models cluster by case affinity
  \item
    Flow efficiency depends on case-specific precision weights
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Adaptation Mechanisms}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Local adjustments: Models modify case assignments based on neighbors
  \item
    Global optimization: System-wide free energy minimization (see
    Equation 1 in the Mathematical Appendix)
  \item
    Adaptation rates follow temporal decay patterns
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Stability Properties}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Case equilibrium: Stable distributions of case assignments
  \item
    Dynamic resilience: Recovery from perturbations
  \item
    Stability emerges from case distribution entropy
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

This framework provides a formal basis for understanding how collections
of case-bearing models can develop sophisticated collective behaviors
analogous to linguistic communities, while maintaining mathematical
rigor through precise formalization of the underlying mechanisms.

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

CEREBRUM provides a structured framework for managing cognitive models
by applying linguistic case principles to represent different functional
roles and relationships. This synthesis of linguistic theory, category
mathematics, active inference, and intelligence production creates a
powerful paradigm for understanding and managing complex model
ecosystems. By treating models as case-bearing entities, CEREBRUM
enables more formalized transformations between model states while
providing intuitive metaphors for model relationships that align with
human cognitive patterns and operational intelligence workflows.

The formal integration of variational free energy principles with case
transformations establishes CEREBRUM as a mathematically rigorous
framework for active inference implementations. The precision-weighted
case selection mechanisms, Markov blanket formulations, and hierarchical
message passing structures provide computationally tractable algorithms
for optimizing model interactions. These technical formalizations bridge
theoretical linguistics and practical cognitive modeling while
maintaining mathematical coherence through category-theoretic
validation.

The CEREBRUM framework represents another milestone in a long journey of
how we conceptualize model relationships, moving from ad hoc integration
approaches, on through seeking the first principles of persistent,
composable, linguistic intelligences. This journey, really an adventure,
continues to have profound implications for theory and practice. By here
incipiently formalizing the grammatical structure of model interactions,
CEREBRUM points towards enhancement of current capabilities and opens
new avenues for modeling emergent behaviors in ecosystems of shared
intelligence. As computational systems continue to grow in complexity,
frameworks like CEREBRUM that provide structured yet flexible approaches
to model management will become increasingly essential for maintaining
conceptual coherence and operational effectiveness.

\subsection{Message Passing Rules for Different
Cases}\label{message-passing-rules-for-different-cases}}

These equations illustrate how case assignments modulate standard
hierarchical message passing (e.g., in predictive coding) where
beliefs/predictions (\(\mu\)) and prediction errors (\(\varepsilon\))
flow between adjacent levels (denoted by superscripts 0 and 1). The
case-specific weights (\(\kappa_c\)) determine the influence of each
message type based on the model's current functional role.

\emph{(Output generated based on lower-level prediction \(\mu^0\),
weighted by \(\kappa_{GEN}\), potentially with noise \(\eta\))}

\[\text{Instrumental [INS]}: process = f(\mu^1, \varepsilon^0) \cdot \kappa_{INS} \tag{12}\]

\emph{(A process output determined by some function \(f\) of top-down
prediction \(\mu^1\) and bottom-up error \(\varepsilon^0\), weighted by
\(\kappa_{INS}\))}

\emph{(Activation state determined by similarity between model identity
\(id\) and incoming address, weighted by \(\kappa_{VOC}\) and passed
through activation function \(\sigma\))}

where \(\kappa_c\) represents case-specific learning rates or precision
weights, \(\eta\) is a noise term, \(\mu^0, \mu^1\) represent
beliefs/predictions, and \(\varepsilon^0, \varepsilon^1\) represent
prediction errors at adjacent hierarchical levels.

Optimization}\label{precision-allocation-and-resource-optimization}}

\[\beta(c,m) = \frac{\exp(-\gamma \cdot F(c,m))}{\sum_i \exp(-\gamma \cdot F(c_i,m))}  \tag{13}\]

where γ is the inverse temperature parameter controlling allocation
sharpness.

\textbf{Equation 14: Resource-Weighted Free Energy}

\[F_{\beta}(m) = \sum_c \beta(c,m) \cdot F(c,m) \cdot R(c)  \tag{14}\]

where R(c) represents the computational resources allocated to case c.

\subsection{Novel Case Formalizations}\label{novel-case-formalizations}}

\textbf{Equation 15: Conjunctive Case Free Energy}

\[
F_{CNJ} = D_{KL}[q(s|CNJ,m) || p(s|m)] - \mathbb{E}_{q(s|CNJ,m)}[\log p(o|s,\{m_i\})]  \tag{15}
\]

where \{m\_i\} represents the assembly of connected models.

\textbf{Equation 16: Conjunctive Case Message Passing}

\[\mu^{CNJ} = \sum_i w_i \cdot \mu_i + \kappa_{CNJ} \cdot (\prod_i \mu_i - \sum_i w_i \cdot \mu_i)  \tag{16}\]

\hypertarget{discovering-and-creating-new-linguistic-cases-through-cerebrum}{%
\section{Discovering and Creating New Linguistic Cases Through
CEREBRUM}\label{discovering-and-creating-new-linguistic-cases-through-cerebrum}}

The CEREBRUM framework not only operationalizes traditional linguistic
cases but potentially enables the discovery of entirely new case
archetypes through its systematic approach to model interactions. As
cognitive models interact in increasingly complex ecosystems, emergent
functional roles may arise that transcend the classical case system
derived from human languages.

\hypertarget{emergence-of-novel-case-functions}{%
\subsection{Emergence of Novel Case
Functions}\label{emergence-of-novel-case-functions}}

Traditional linguistic case systems evolved to serve human communication
needs in physical and social environments. However, computational
cognitive ecosystems face novel challenges and opportunities that may
drive the emergence of new functional roles. The mathematical formalism
of CEREBRUM provides a scaffold for identifying these emergent case
functions through:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Pattern detection in model interaction graphs}: Recurring
  patterns of information flow that don't fit established cases
\item
  \textbf{Free energy anomalies}: Unusual optimization patterns
  indicating novel functional configurations
\item
  \textbf{Precision allocation clusters}: Statistical clustering of
  precision weightings revealing new functional categories
\item
  \textbf{Transition probability densities}: Dense regions in case
  transition probability spaces suggesting stable new cases
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{speculative-novel-case-the-emergent-conjunctive-case}{%
\subsection{Speculative Novel Case: The Emergent ``Conjunctive''
Case}\label{speculative-novel-case-the-emergent-conjunctive-case}}

One speculative example of a novel case that might emerge within
CEREBRUM is what we might term the ``conjunctive'' case {[}CNJ{]}. This
case would represent a model's role in synthesizing multiple predictive
streams into coherent joint predictions that couldn't be achieved
through simple composition of existing cases.

The mathematical formalism for a model in conjunctive case would extend
the standard free energy equation as shown in Equation 15 (see
Mathematical Appendix), representing the assembly of connected models
participating in the joint prediction. The key innovation is that the
likelihood term explicitly depends on multiple models' predictions
rather than a single model's output, enabling integration of diverse
predictive streams.

In the message-passing formulation, the conjunctive case would introduce
unique update rules as described in Equation 16 (see Mathematical
Appendix), with weighting factors for individual model predictions, as
well as a multiplicative integration of predictions that captures
interdependencies beyond simple weighted averaging. This formulation
enables rich joint inference across model collectives.

\hypertarget{speculative-novel-case-the-recursive-case}{%
\subsection{Speculative Novel Case: The ``Recursive''
Case}\label{speculative-novel-case-the-recursive-case}}

Another potential novel case is the ``recursive'' case {[}REC{]}, which
would enable a model to apply its transformations to itself, creating a
form of computational reflection not captured by traditional cases.

In the recursive case, a model assumes both agent and object roles
simultaneously, creating feedback loops that enable complex
self-modification behaviors. This case would be particularly relevant
for metalearning systems and artificial neural networks that modify
their own architectures.

The recursive case would introduce unique precision dynamics as
formalized in Equation 17 (see Mathematical Appendix). The key
innovation is that the model appears on both sides of the
transformation, creating a form of self-reference that traditional case
systems don't accommodate. This enables models to introspect and modify
their own parameters through self-directed transformations.

\hypertarget{speculative-novel-case-the-metaphorical-case}{%
\subsection{Speculative Novel Case: The ``Metaphorical''
Case}\label{speculative-novel-case-the-metaphorical-case}}

A third potential novel case is the ``metaphorical'' case {[}MET{]},
which would enable a model to map structures and relationships from one
domain to another, creating computational analogies that transfer
knowledge across conceptual spaces.

In the metaphorical case, a model acts as a transformation bridge
between disparate domains, establishing systematic mappings between
conceptual structures. This case would be particularly valuable for
transfer learning systems and creative problem-solving algorithms that
need to apply learned patterns in novel contexts.

The metaphorical case would introduce unique cross-domain mapping
functions as formalized in Equation 18 (see Mathematical Appendix). The
key innovation is the structured alignment of latent representations
across domains, enabling principled knowledge transfer that preserves
relational invariants while adapting to target domain constraints.

\hypertarget{connections-to-human-cognition-and-communication}{%
\subsubsection{Connections to Human Cognition and
Communication}\label{connections-to-human-cognition-and-communication}}

The metaphorical case has rich connections to multiple domains of human
cognition and communication. In affective neuroscience, it models how
emotional experiences are mapped onto conceptual frameworks, explaining
how we understand emotions through bodily metaphors (e.g., ``heavy
heart,'' ``burning anger''). In first and second-person neuroscience,
metaphorical mappings enable perspective-taking and empathy through
systematic projection of one's own experiential models onto others.
Educational contexts leverage metaphorical case operations when complex
concepts are taught through familiar analogies, making abstract ideas
concrete through structured mappings. The way people converse about
generative models often employs metaphorical language---describing
models as ``thinking,'' ``imagining,'' or ``dreaming''---which
represents a natural metaphorical mapping between human cognitive
processes and computational operations. Learning itself fundamentally
involves metaphorical operations when knowledge from one domain
scaffolds understanding in another. Perhaps most profoundly, the
metaphorical case provides a computational framework for understanding
how symbols and archetypes function in human cognition---as cross-domain
mappings that compress complex experiential patterns into transferable,
culturally-shared representations that retain their structural integrity
across diverse contexts while adapting to individual interpretive
frameworks.

\hypertarget{implications-of-novel-cases-for-computational-cognition}{%
\subsection{Implications of Novel Cases for Computational
Cognition}\label{implications-of-novel-cases-for-computational-cognition}}

The discovery of novel cases through CEREBRUM could have profound
implications for computational cognitive science:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Expanded representational capacity}: New cases enable
  representation of functional relationships beyond traditional
  linguistic frameworks
\item
  \textbf{Enhanced model compositionality}: Novel cases might enable
  more efficient composition of complex model assemblies
\item
  \textbf{Computational reflection}: Cases like the recursive case
  enable systematic implementation of self-modifying systems
\item
  \textbf{Cross-domain integration}: New cases like the metaphorical
  case might bridge domains that are difficult to connect with
  traditional case systems
\end{enumerate}

These speculative extensions of CEREBRUM highlight its potential not
just as an implementation of linguistic ideas in computational contexts,
but as a framework that could expand our understanding of functional
roles beyond traditional linguistic categories. The mathematical rigor
of CEREBRUM provides a foundation for systematically exploring this
expanded space of possible case functions, potentially leading to
entirely new paradigms for understanding complex model interactions in
cognitive systems.
