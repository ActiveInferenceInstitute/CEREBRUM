# Somatic Therapy Session

**Date**: June 15, 2025
**Session**: #8
**Therapist**: Dr. Maya Wilson
**Client**: Alex Thompson

**Dr. Wilson**: Welcome, Alex. How are you feeling today?

**Alex**: Tense. I can feel tightness in my shoulders.

**Dr. Wilson**: Can you take a moment to notice what's happening in your body?

**Alex**: *[takes a deep breath]* My shoulders are up by my ears. When I focus, I feel a pulsing heat running down to my upper back.

**Dr. Wilson**: What comes to mind when you observe this sensation?

**Alex**: The work deadline. Every time I get an email from my boss, I feel like I'm bracing for impact.

**Dr. Wilson**: If that tension could speak, what might it say?

**Alex**: *[emotional]* "I can't do enough. It's never going to be enough." It reminds me of how I felt with my dad's high expectations.

**Dr. Wilson**: Would you be willing to try something? Put one hand on your heart and one on your stomach.

**Alex**: *[places hands]* It feels supportive. My shoulders just dropped a little.

**Dr. Wilson**: What are you noticing?

**Alex**: More spaciousness. Like there's room to breathe. The tension is still there, but doesn't feel overwhelming.
