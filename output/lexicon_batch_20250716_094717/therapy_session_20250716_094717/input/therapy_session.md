# Somatic Therapy Session

**Date**: June 15, 2025  
**Session**: #8  
**Therapist**: Dr. Maya Wilson  
**Client**: Alex Thompson

**Dr. Wilson**: Welcome, Alex. How are you feeling today?

**Alex**: Tense. I can feel tightness in my shoulders.

**Dr. Wilson**: When you notice the tension, where do you sense it most?

**Alex**: Mostly in my shoulders and neck. Sometimes it feels like a weight pressing on me.  
I wish I could let go of this heaviness, but it seems to come from my work stress.  
My friend's advice helps a bit, and I try to give myself some compassion.  
Dr. Wilson, can you guide me through a grounding exercise?

**Dr. Wilson**: Of course. Let's begin by noticing the support of the chair beneath you.

**Alex**: I can feel the chair against my back, but the tension in my shoulders is still there.

**Dr. Wilson**: That's perfectly normal, Alex. Let's acknowledge that tension without trying to change it. What does your breathing feel like right now?

**Alex**: Shallow. My breath feels stuck around my chest area, like the work stress is creating a barrier.

**Dr. Wilson**: I notice you've mentioned work stress several times today. Can you tell me more about how that manifests in your shoulders?

**Alex**: It's like my shoulders carry the weight of every deadline, every meeting with my boss, Sarah. When I think about Sarah's expectations, my shoulders just clench up automatically.

**Dr. Wilson**: Thank you for sharing that, Alex. Sarah seems to be a significant figure in your work stress. Let's try something - can you imagine releasing just a tiny bit of tension from your shoulders?

**Alex**: Dr. Wilson, I'm trying, but when I think about tomorrow's presentation to Sarah and the board, my shoulders just tense up again.

**Dr. Wilson**: That's valuable information. Your body is telling us something important about your relationship with work stress and authority figures like Sarah. Let's stay with your shoulders for a moment - what would they say if they could speak?

**Alex**: They'd probably say "Put me down! I'm tired of carrying this burden!" Actually, Dr. Wilson, now that I think about it, my friend Marcus always tells me to drop my shoulders when we're walking together.

**Dr. Wilson**: Marcus sounds like a caring friend. How does it feel when Marcus reminds you about your shoulders?

**Alex**: Helpful. But sometimes I forget, and then the work stress with Sarah and the deadlines just builds up in my shoulders again. It's like a cycle.

**Dr. Wilson**: You've identified a pattern, Alex - work stress, Sarah, your shoulders, and how Marcus's support helps. That's significant awareness. Let's end today with one conscious breath, allowing your shoulders to simply be as they are.

**Alex**: Thank you, Dr. Wilson. I feel like understanding this pattern between my shoulders and work stress is already helping.
