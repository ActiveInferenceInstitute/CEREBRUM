Residual Analysis:
- Mean of residuals: 0.000000
- Standard deviation: 0.104852
- Range: [-0.288333, 0.258398]

Linguistic Analysis (ACCUSATIVE Case):
- The model is the OBJECT receiving the action of evaluation
- Verbs acting on the model: Test, Evaluate, Validate, Assess
- Subjects performing the action: Researchers, Analysts, Tests

Linguistic Formula Example:
We evaluate the MODEL on test data.
