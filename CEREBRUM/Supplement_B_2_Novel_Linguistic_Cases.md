# Appendix B 2: Novel Linguistic Cases

## Discovering and Creating New Linguistic Cases Through CEREBRUM

The CEREBRUM framework not only operationalizes traditional linguistic cases but potentially enables the discovery of entirely new case archetypes through its systematic approach to model interactions. As cognitive models interact in increasingly complex ecosystems, emergent functional roles may arise that transcend the classical case system derived from human languages.

### Emergence of Novel Case Functions

Traditional linguistic case systems evolved to serve human communication needs in physical and social environments. However, computational cognitive ecosystems face novel challenges and opportunities that may drive the emergence of new functional roles. The mathematical formalism of CEREBRUM provides a scaffold for identifying these emergent case functions through:

1. **Pattern detection in model interaction graphs**: Recurring patterns of information flow that don't fit established cases
2. **Free energy anomalies**: Unusual optimization patterns indicating novel functional configurations
3. **Precision allocation clusters**: Statistical clustering of precision weightings revealing new functional categories
4. **Transition probability densities**: Dense regions in case transition probability spaces suggesting stable new cases

### Speculative Novel Case: The Emergent "Conjunctive" Case

One speculative example of a novel case that might emerge within CEREBRUM is what we might term the "conjunctive" case [CNJ]. This case would represent a model's role in synthesizing multiple predictive streams into coherent joint predictions that couldn't be achieved through simple composition of existing cases.

The mathematical formalism for a model in conjunctive case would extend the standard free energy equation as shown in Equation 15 (see Mathematical Appendix), representing the assembly of connected models participating in the joint prediction. The key innovation is that the likelihood term explicitly depends on multiple models' predictions rather than a single model's output, enabling integration of diverse predictive streams.

In the message-passing formulation, the conjunctive case would introduce unique update rules as described in Equation 16 (see Mathematical Appendix), with weighting factors for individual model predictions, as well as a multiplicative integration of predictions that captures interdependencies beyond simple weighted averaging. This formulation enables rich joint inference across model collectives.

### Speculative Novel Case: The "Recursive" Case

Another potential novel case is the "recursive" case [REC], which would enable a model to apply its transformations to itself, creating a form of computational reflection not captured by traditional cases.

In the recursive case, a model assumes both agent and object roles simultaneously, creating feedback loops that enable complex self-modification behaviors. This case would be particularly relevant for metalearning systems and artificial neural networks that modify their own architectures.

The recursive case would introduce unique precision dynamics as formalized in Equation 17 (see Mathematical Appendix). The key innovation is that the model appears on both sides of the transformation, creating a form of self-reference that traditional case systems don't accommodate. This enables models to introspect and modify their own parameters through self-directed transformations.

### Speculative Novel Case: The "Metaphorical" Case

A third potential novel case is the "metaphorical" case [MET], which would enable a model to map structures and relationships from one domain to another, creating computational analogies that transfer knowledge across conceptual spaces.

In the metaphorical case, a model acts as a transformation bridge between disparate domains, establishing systematic mappings between conceptual structures. This case would be particularly valuable for transfer learning systems and creative problem-solving algorithms that need to apply learned patterns in novel contexts.

The metaphorical case would introduce unique cross-domain mapping functions as formalized in Equation 18 (see Mathematical Appendix). The key innovation is the structured alignment of latent representations across domains, enabling principled knowledge transfer that preserves relational invariants while adapting to target domain constraints.

#### Connections to Human Cognition and Communication

The metaphorical case has rich connections to multiple domains of human cognition and communication. In affective neuroscience, it models how emotional experiences are mapped onto conceptual frameworks, explaining how we understand emotions through bodily metaphors (e.g., "heavy heart," "burning anger"). In first and second-person neuroscience, metaphorical mappings enable perspective-taking and empathy through systematic projection of one's own experiential models onto others. Educational contexts leverage metaphorical case operations when complex concepts are taught through familiar analogies, making abstract ideas concrete through structured mappings. The way people converse about generative models often employs metaphorical language—describing models as "thinking," "imagining," or "dreaming"—which represents a natural metaphorical mapping between human cognitive processes and computational operations. Learning itself fundamentally involves metaphorical operations when knowledge from one domain scaffolds understanding in another. Perhaps most profoundly, the metaphorical case provides a computational framework for understanding how symbols and archetypes function in human cognition—as cross-domain mappings that compress complex experiential patterns into transferable, culturally-shared representations that retain their structural integrity across diverse contexts while adapting to individual interpretive frameworks.

### Implications of Novel Cases for Computational Cognition

The discovery of novel cases through CEREBRUM could have profound implications for computational cognitive science:

1. **Expanded representational capacity**: New cases enable representation of functional relationships beyond traditional linguistic frameworks
2. **Enhanced model compositionality**: Novel cases might enable more efficient composition of complex model assemblies
3. **Computational reflection**: Cases like the recursive case enable systematic implementation of self-modifying systems
4. **Cross-domain integration**: New cases like the metaphorical case might bridge domains that are difficult to connect with traditional case systems

These speculative extensions of CEREBRUM highlight its potential not just as an implementation of linguistic ideas in computational contexts, but as a framework that could expand our understanding of functional roles beyond traditional linguistic categories. The mathematical rigor of CEREBRUM provides a foundation for systematically exploring this expanded space of possible case functions, potentially leading to entirely new paradigms for understanding complex model interactions in cognitive systems.
