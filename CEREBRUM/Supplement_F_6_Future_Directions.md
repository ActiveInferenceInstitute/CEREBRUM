## F.2 Programming Libraries and Implementation Frameworks

### F.2.1 Technical Challenges

The development of robust programming libraries for CEREBRUM faces several technical challenges:

3. **Performance Optimization**: Case transformations must be efficiently implemented to minimize computational overhead, particularly for real-time applications.
4. **Cross-Language Compatibility**: CEREBRUM implementations should maintain consistent semantics across different programming languages and paradigms.

### F.2.2 Proposed Implementation Approaches

1. **Core Language-Agnostic Specification**:
   ```
   # Pseudocode for CEREBRUM model interface
   class CaseModel<T>:
     enum Case { NOM, ACC, DAT, GEN, INS, LOC, ABL, VOC }
     
     # Core model properties
     P: ParametricStructure
     S: StateSpace<T>
     Î˜: Parameters
     I: InputInterfaces
     O: OutputInterfaces
     C: Case
     
     # Case transformation method
     transform(targetCase: Case): CaseModel<T>
