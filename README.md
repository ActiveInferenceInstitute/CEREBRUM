## Overview
CEREBRUM is a unified modeling framework that integrates case-based reasoning with Bayesian representations.

## PDF Documentation
The full documentation for CEREBRUM is available as a PDF file (`CEREBRUM/CEREBRUM.pdf`), which is generated from the Markdown source files.

### Requirements for PDF Generation
To regenerate the PDF documentation, you need:
- Python 3
- pandoc
- A LaTeX distribution with xelatex (like TeX Live or MiKTeX)

### Generating the PDF
To regenerate the PDF documentation, run:

```bash
python3 tools/render_markdown.py
```

This script will:
1. Execute the `render_mermaids.py` script to generate diagrams from Mermaid syntax (unless skipped via arguments).
2. Process the main Markdown file (`CEREBRUM/CEREBRUM.md`).
3. Find, order, and include appendix files (matching `CEREBRUM/Supplement_*.md` by default).
4. Generate the final PDF file at `CEREBRUM/CEREBRUM.pdf`.

The PDF includes proper formatting, a table of contents, section numbering, and embedded figures.
