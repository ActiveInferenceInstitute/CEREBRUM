## Overview
CEREBRUM is a unified modeling framework that integrates case-based reasoning with Bayesian representations. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools for developing, testing, and deploying cognitive models that combine the strengths of case-based reasoning with probabilistic inference.

Key features include:
- Integration of symbolic case structures with Bayesian probabilistic representations
- Flexible transformation engine for model adaptation and learning
- Multiple language implementations with consistent APIs
- Visualization tools for model inspection and analysis
- Extensive example library demonstrating applications across domains

## Implementation Workflow

## Getting Started

CEREBRUM can be used in multiple ways depending on your needs:

1. **Explore existing models**: Check out the `/src/examples` directory
2. **Create your own models**: Follow the guides in `/docs/getting_started.md`
3. **Extend the framework**: See `/docs/contributing_technical.md` for development setup

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ActiveInferenceInstitute/CEREBRUM.git
cd CEREBRUM

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For development
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
```

## PDF Documentation
The full documentation for CEREBRUM is available as a PDF file in the `paper/output/` directory, which is generated from the Markdown source files.

### Requirements for PDF Generation
To regenerate the PDF documentation, you need:
- Python 3
- Node.js with Mermaid CLI (`@mermaid-js/mermaid-cli` package)
- Pandoc
- XeLaTeX (for PDF generation)

### Generating the PDF
To regenerate the PDF documentation, run:

```bash
python3 paper/assemble_paper.py
```

This script will:
1. Render all Mermaid diagrams from `paper/components/figures/` to PNG images
2. Assemble all markdown components in the correct order
3. Generate an HTML version of the paper
4. Create the final PDF file at `paper/output/assembled_paper.pdf`

For more detailed information about the paper building process, please see `paper/README.md`.
