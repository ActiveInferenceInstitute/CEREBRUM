## Overview
CEREBRUM is a unified modeling framework that integrates case-based reasoning with Bayesian representations.

## PDF Documentation
The full documentation for CEREBRUM is available as a PDF file in the `paper/output/` directory, which is generated from the Markdown source files.

### Requirements for PDF Generation
To regenerate the PDF documentation, you need:
- Python 3
- Node.js with Mermaid CLI (`@mermaid-js/mermaid-cli` package)
- Pandoc
- XeLaTeX (for PDF generation)

### Generating the PDF
To regenerate the PDF documentation, run:

```bash
python3 paper/assemble_paper.py
```

This script will:
1. Render all Mermaid diagrams from `paper/components/figures/` to PNG images
2. Assemble all markdown components in the correct order
3. Generate an HTML version of the paper
4. Create the final PDF file at `paper/output/assembled_paper.pdf`

For more detailed information about the paper building process, please see `paper/README.md`.
