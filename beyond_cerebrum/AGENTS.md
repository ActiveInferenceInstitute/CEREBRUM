# Beyond CEREBRUM: FORMICA Context

## Agentic Context

This directory contains experimental and conceptual work for FORMICA (Formal Representation and Modeling Integrating Comprehensive Aspects), which extends beyond the core CEREBRUM framework.

## Status

- **Experimental**: Code here is likely prototypical and may not adhere to the same strict standards as `src`.
- **Conceptual**: Much of the value here is in `beyond_spec.md` and the directory structure itself, representing a proposed architecture.

## Interaction Guidelines

- **Exploration**: Use this directory to understand future directions or experimental extensions.
- **Caution**: Do not treat code here as production-ready core dependencies for CEREBRUM unless explicitly stabilized.

## Key Files

- `beyond_spec.md`: The primary specification for the experimental framework.
