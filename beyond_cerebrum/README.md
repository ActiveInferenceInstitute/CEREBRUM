# Beyond CEREBRUM: FORMICA Conceptualization

This directory contains conceptual work and initial planning for FORMICA (**FO**rmal **R**epresentation and **M**odeling **I**ntegrating **C**omprehensive **A**spects), a proposed framework extending beyond the scope of CEREBRUM.

## Contents

*   `beyond_spec.md`: The primary specification document outlining the vision, goals, architecture, challenges, and potential roadmap for FORMICA.
*   `src/`: A placeholder directory structure for the potential source code of the FORMICA framework. It includes subdirectories for:
    *   `formalisms/`: Linguistic structure representations (syntax, semantics, etc.).
    *   `operations/`: Computational actions on linguistic structures.
    *   `backends/`: Adapters for different ML/computation backends.
    *   `analysis/`: Tools for interpretability, safety, and lexical environment forensics.
    *   `utils/`: Utility code.

## Purpose

This directory serves as a sandbox for exploring the theoretical underpinnings and high-level design of a comprehensive, model-agnostic computational framework for language, aiming to formalize all aspects of linguistic intelligence.
