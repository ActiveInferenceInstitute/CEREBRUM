# FORMICA Formalism Theory

This directory contains documents detailing the theoretical underpinnings of the FORMICA linguistic formalisms.

## Files

*   `type_system.md`: Detailed specification of the linguistic type system (base types, composite types, type constructors, dependent types).
*   `calculus.md`: Specification of the linguistic calculus (primitive operations, transformations, inference operations, composition rules).
*   `bayesian_integration.md`: Details on how Bayesian inference is integrated with the formal structures and calculus.
*   `category_theory_notes.md`: (Optional) Exploratory notes on applying category theory concepts.
