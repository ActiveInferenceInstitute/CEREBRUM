"""
Placeholder for Category Theory elements in FORMICA.

This module is intended for defining concepts like Categories, Objects,
Morphisms, Functors, Monads etc., if FORMICA adopts a strong
Categorical perspective for modeling linguistic structures and processes.

Note: Implementing significant category theory machinery in Python can be complex.
Consider using existing libraries or focusing on conceptual mapping first.

# Potentially define categories like:

# - CatSem: Category of Semantic Structures
# - CatMorph: Category of Morphological Forms

# And Functors mapping between them:
# - ParsingFunctor: CatSyn -> CatSem
# - GenerationFunctor: CatSem -> CatSyn

# TODO: Evaluate the feasibility and benefit of a deep CT integration.
# TODO: Explore libraries like `category_encoders` (for data science, not pure CT) or academic projects.
# TODO: Define concrete linguistic categories and functors if this path is pursued.
