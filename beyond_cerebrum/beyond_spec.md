# FORMICA: FOrmal Representation and Modeling Integrating Comprehensive Aspects - Specification

## 1. Introduction and Vision

### 1.1. Motivation: Beyond CEREBRUM

CEREBRUM provides a powerful framework for integrating case-based reasoning and Bayesian representations, focusing significantly on the role of grammatical case in structuring meaning and reasoning. While valuable, case grammar represents only one facet of the complex system that is human (or potentially non-human) language. To achieve a truly comprehensive computational understanding of linguistic intelligence, we must expand our scope significantly.

### 1.2. Vision: A Universal Computational Formalism for Language

This document outlines the specification for FORMICA (**FO**rmal **R**epresentation and **M**odeling **I**ntegrating **C**omprehensive **A**spects). The vision is to develop a framework that:

1.  **Formalizes** the vast majority of linguistic structures and functions (syntax, semantics, pragmatics, morphology, phonology, discourse, etc.) in a computationally tractable manner.
2.  **Operationalizes** these formalisms as computable procedures or transformations.
3.  **Integrates** these operations within diverse computational modeling paradigms (e.g., Neural Networks, Bayesian Graphical Models, Symbolic Systems, Hybrid Architectures).
4.  Provides a **universal foundation** for modeling, comparing, and potentially even discovering principles of linguistic intelligence, including applications to xeno- and exo-linguistics.

The ultimate goal is not merely to simulate language processing but to create a system that *reasons* about and *generates* language based on deep, formalized structural principles, applicable across different cognitive architectures.

## 2. Core Concepts

FORMICA is built upon the integration of comprehensive linguistic representation with flexible computational modeling. The core theoretical concepts underpinning this integration include:

### 2.1. Comprehensive Linguistic Formalization

FORMICA aims to create computationally tractable formalisms for a wide spectrum of linguistic phenomena:

*   **Levels of Representation:** Explicitly defining structures for Phonology/Prosody, Morphology, Lexicon, Syntax, Semantics, Pragmatics, and Discourse.
*   **Interactions:** Modeling the interfaces and information flow between these levels (e.g., syntax-semantics interface, prosody-pragmatics connection).

### 2.2. Formal Foundations: Type Theory and Category Theory

To ensure rigor and enable systematic composition, FORMICA's linguistic representations will be grounded in formal mathematical structures:

*   **Type System:**
    *   Define base types for fundamental linguistic units (e.g., `Phoneme`, `Morpheme`, `LexicalItem`, `SyntacticConstituent`, `SemanticConcept`, `PragmaticContext`, `DiscourseUnit`).
    *   Define composite types using type constructors (e.g., `List[Phoneme]`, `Tree[SyntacticConstituent]`, `Graph[SemanticConcept]`, `Function[PragmaticContext, SemanticConcept]`).
    *   Utilize dependent types where necessary to capture constraints (e.g., a verb type that depends on the types of its required arguments).
    *   Explore connections to formal grammar frameworks (e.g., Lambek Calculus, Type-Logical Grammar, Abstract Categorial Grammar).
*   **Categorical Perspective (Optional but potentially powerful):**
    *   Represent linguistic structures as objects in a category (or multiple related categories).
    *   Represent linguistic processes (parsing, generation, translation, inference) as morphisms (structure-preserving maps) between these objects.
    *   Utilize categorical constructs (e.g., limits, colimits, functors, monads) to model compositionality, context-dependency, and transformations.
    *   *Example:* A functor mapping syntactic structures (category `Syn`) to semantic structures (category `Sem`).

### 2.3. The Linguistic Calculus: Operations and Transformations

Building on the formal foundations, FORMICA defines a 'calculus' of operations:

*   **Primitive Operations:** Basic building blocks for manipulating linguistic structures (e.g., `unify(struct1, struct2)`, `project(structure, feature)`, `compose(morphism1, morphism2)`, `apply(function, argument)`).
*   **Structural Transformations:** Operations that change the *type* or *shape* of linguistic representations (e.g., mapping a syntactic tree to a semantic graph, morphological decomposition, pragmatic enrichment).
*   **Inference Operations:** Operations that derive new information or modify belief states based on linguistic input (e.g., `infer_meaning(syntax_tree, context)`, `update_belief(current_belief, utterance)`, `resolve_reference(discourse_model, referring_expression)`).
*   **Compositionality:** Define how operations combine systematically, mirroring the compositionality principles of the underlying linguistic formalisms (Type/Category Theory).

### 2.4. Bayesian Cognitive Functions

Uncertainty, learning, and context-sensitivity are handled via principled probabilistic methods, primarily Bayesian inference, integrated *within* the formal structure:

*   **Probabilistic Types/Representations:** Augmenting formal linguistic structures with probability distributions (e.g., probability distribution over possible parses, P(Meaning | Syntax, Context), probability distribution over speaker intentions).
*   **Bayesian Inference as Operations:** Framing parsing, interpretation, and learning as Bayesian inference problems solved by specific operations within the calculus (e.g., finding the maximum a posteriori parse tree, updating a probabilistic discourse model).
*   **Integration with Formal Structure:** Defining how Bayesian updates interact with the type system and categorical structures (e.g., Bayesian updates over morphisms, probabilistic type checking).
*   **Learning:** Formalizing parameter learning (e.g., lexicon probabilities, grammar rule weights) and structure learning (e.g., inducing new grammar rules or semantic relations) within a Bayesian framework.

### 2.5. Computational Operationalization

The core innovation lies in translating these rich formalisms into concrete computational operations. This involves:

*   Defining data structures capable of representing the complex linguistic features (e.g., enhanced graph structures, hypergraphs, specialized tensors).
*   Specifying algorithms and transformations that manipulate these structures (e.g., graph rewriting rules, structure mapping functions, probabilistic inference over structures).
*   Ensuring these operations capture the dynamic and flexible nature of language use.
*   **Grounded Pragmatism (Inspired by "Entomological Pragmatism"):** Operations related to pragmatics and context should be designed with a focus on communicative *action* and *effect* within an environment, emphasizing efficiency and context-sensitivity, akin to the functional nature of simpler biological communication systems.

### 2.6. Model Agnosticism and Integration

FORMICA is designed to be a *meta-framework*, providing the linguistic "operating system" upon which different computational "hardware" (models) can run.

*   **Abstraction Layer:** Define a clear API or intermediate representation (IR) for linguistic structures and operations.
*   **Adapters/Compilers:** Develop mechanisms to translate the FORMICA IR and operations into forms usable by specific backends (e.g., converting syntactic dependencies into attention patterns for a Transformer, or semantic relations into factors in a Bayesian network).
*   **Hybrid Potential:** Facilitate hybrid models where different components (e.g., syntax vs. semantics) might be handled by different model types unified under FORMICA.

### 2.7. Universality and Extensibility

*   **Cross-linguistic Applicability:** The formalisms should strive for universality, capturing parameters of variation across human languages.
*   **Xeno/Exo-Linguistics:** The framework should be theoretically capable of representing and reasoning about linguistic systems with principles potentially different from human language.
*   **Modularity:** Designed for extension, allowing new linguistic theories or computational models to be incorporated over time.

## 3. Proposed Architecture and Structure

### 3.1. Conceptual Layers

A potential layered architecture:

1.  **Input Processing Layer:** Handles raw input (text, speech) and performs initial tagging/parsing into basic linguistic structures.
2.  **Linguistic Representation Layer:** Constructs the rich, formalized FORMICA linguistic representation (syntax, semantics, pragmatics, etc.).
3.  **Operationalization Layer:** Maps linguistic structures and communicative goals to FORMICA operations (transformations, inferences).
4.  **Backend Interface Layer:** Translates FORMICA operations into backend-specific computations via adapters/compilers.
5.  **Computational Backend Layer(s):** Executes computations using integrated models (NNs, Bayesian Nets, Symbolic Reasoners, etc.).
6.  **Analysis & Monitoring Layer:** Provides tools for interpretability, safety checks, and **lexical environment forensics** (tracking semantic usage, grounding, drift). This layer interacts with the Representation, Operationalization, and Backend layers.
7.  **Output Generation Layer:** Translates results from backends/operations back into linguistic form or environment actions.

### 3.2. Proposed Directory Structure (`beyond_cerebrum/src/`)

The conceptual codebase might be organized as follows:

*   `src/formalisms/`: Modules defining the data structures and theoretical bases.
    *   `types.py`: Core linguistic type definitions.
    *   `structures.py`: Implementation of composite structures (trees, graphs).
    *   `categories.py`: (Optional) Definitions related to categorical modeling.
    *   `theory/`: Markdown documents detailing the specific type system, categorical mappings, etc.
*   `src/operations/`: Modules implementing the core computational operations.

*   `src/interfaces/`: APIs for input processing and output generation.
*   `src/utils/`: Common utilities and helper functions.

## 4. Research Challenges and ML Integration

*   Developing sufficiently expressive yet computationally tractable universal formalisms (**especially the type/category theory integration**).
*   Handling ambiguity, context, and underspecification robustly (**leveraging Bayesian methods within the formal calculus**).
*   Defining the "calculus" of linguistic operations and their grounding (**ensuring mathematical soundness and computational feasibility**).
*   Creating effective translation mechanisms (adapters) for diverse computational backends (**mapping formal operations to backend primitives**).
*   Scalability and computational complexity.
*   **Interpretability:** Leveraging the explicit linguistic structures in FORMICA to provide deeper model interpretability than possible with end-to-end black-box models. Connecting FORMICA operations to backend model behaviour (e.g., attention patterns, node activations).
*   **Safety & Alignment:** Using formal linguistic representations to specify safety constraints, detect harmful or biased language generation, and potentially align model behavior with explicit communicative norms or goals.
*   **Scaling Laws:** Investigating how performance on linguistically complex tasks scales with model size *and* the richness of the FORMICA formalism used.
*   **Forensic Analysis:** Developing robust methods within the `analysis` module to track how a model's internal 'lexicon' and semantic representations evolve over time and across different contexts (lexical environment forensics).
*   Validation: How to rigorously test and validate such a comprehensive framework? Against linguistic data? Cognitive experiments? Task performance? Adversarial testing?
*   Integrating symbolic grounding and world knowledge effectively.

## 5. Relation to CEREBRUM

*   FORMICA subsumes the goals of CEREBRUM regarding case grammar.
*   CEREBRUM's case representation and Bayesian integration could serve as an initial module or proof-of-concept within the broader FORMICA architecture.
*   Lessons learned from CEREBRUM's case-based reasoning and Bayesian modeling will inform the design of FORMICA's representation and backend integration strategies.
